<blockquote><p><strong>“Marketers are no longer in the business of selling products – we are selling experiences.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The proliferation of technology, such as smartphones and the Internet of Things, make it possible to engage with customers on a one-to-one basis. However, the challenge is meeting their expectations to provide continuous, consistent, and compelling experiences both digitally and in reality.</p>
<p>Clients often come to us with the same three digital marketing challenges that can be solved with a solid marketing technology platform.

In the words of Demandware VP Tom Griffin:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>By integrating best-in-class rich content authoring and creation with best-in-class enterprise commerce, we can provide a single, unified solution for all consumer touchpoints. At the same time, retailers can optimize and personalize the shopping experience, in real time, by testing different content types based on purchase data. (Tom Griffin, Demandware)</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Makes good sense, doesn’t it? The integration of best-in-class content authoring and publishing, digital marketing and analytics (Adobe) with an omnichannel commerce engine and storefront (Demandware) is so obvious that it’s kind of a no-brainer.</p>
<p>Of course, integrating content and commerce is nothing new. We’ve been doing it since the earliest days of the internet as a sales engine.  The two diverged as specialized platforms for first web content management, and then e-commerce, became the rage in the past decade—but the obvious next step on either side was to reach back out and embrace the other.</p>
<p>Certain platforms and software companies have seen limited success in this regard, but for quite some time the only way for an online retailer to achieve a “best-in-class” experience was through custom integration between a pure-play CMS and a pure-play e-commerce platform.<span id="more-3264"></span></p>
<h2>Born in the Cloud</h2>
<p>To some extent, that’s still the case; Adobe and Demandware remain different companies with different software platforms and different licenses.  The value of this particular partnership, however—what sets it apart and makes it so exciting—is that it’s born in the cloud.</p>
<p>The Adobe Marketing Cloud is more than just the CMS—Adobe Experience Manager.  It’s digital marketing and analytics, rich media and more, and it’s a unified cloud platform offering the flexibility and scalability that software-as-a-service provides as its primary value proposition.  Similarly, Demandware is a purely cloud-based solution— and that cloud DNA is what sets it apart from the rest of its peers.  The ability to scale up or down quickly to meet demand is a huge advantage for any retailer—B2C or B2B—who anticipates seasonal or market-driven shifts in volume.</p>
<h2>Not Quite Yet, Though…</h2>
<p>Naturally, there will be challenges down the road as these software companies seek to present an integrated offering.  The integration itself is officially still in pilot mode, and big questions are yet to be answered.  As a wizened green Jedi Master told us back in 1980, “Always in motion, the future is.”  On balance, though, the prospects offered by this announcement are too exciting to ignore.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Abbie Wombach holds the FIFA record for the most international goals among men and women soccer players. She&#8217;s also a two time Olympic Gold Medalist</p>
<p>Question: Since you retired you&#8217;ve been doing cool things</p>
<p>Answer: I&#8217;ve been pretty busy.  I traveled around the world talking to FIFA and CEO&#8217;s  I want to change the world.  There&#8217;s a need to positively impact your environment.  Get equal opportunity for everyone.  Let&#8217;s focus on more than a niche. Everyone deserves a shot to be treated equally</p>
<p>Question: You are an inspiration to millions worldwide.  The key is the inequality to the gap in pay.  That includes in soccer.  This gap and how people think about it.</p>
<p>Answer: 10-15 years ago the conversation would have been different with the recent comments of ??. Hr resigned today but that wouldn&#8217;t have happened   It means</p>
<p>Question: You won the world cup and made $2M for the team. Germany won last year and came back with $35M.<span id="more-3205"></span></p>
<p>Answer: Look at the data.  We had more viewership than any other event so it needs to be resolved.</p>
<p>Question: You have such a great brand as the womens team.</p>
<p>Answer: It gives me chills to see that happen. It&#8217;s great to see men, especially professional players to give that respect. It&#8217;s been a long time that it&#8217;s been earned.  We work to gain respect.</p>
<p>Question: You went to the Whitehouse and what did he call you</p>
<p>Answer: uh, he called me the greatest of all time</p>
<p>Question: you were the youngest of 7 kids. Was eating with a huge family ever a problem</p>
<p>Answer: Yeah, I eat too quickly because I had to compete for the food. You can see why I was able to build the body I was able to build.  Be proud of your body women. Having a huge family was really impactful.  Coming from somewhere is important. Those are the things that propel you. they are the dynamite in your shoes.  Use your past as a positive to push you forward.</p>
<p>Question: Adobe Summit, the theme is about experience. Your life is one experience after another.  You&#8217;ve had this amazing career which culminated in what most would make you the greatest women&#8217;s soccer player of all time. What&#8217; stands out.</p>
<p>Answer: loaded question.   It was winning the medals but more importantly it was the locker room after.  There&#8217;s nothing better than that. Then comes seeing your family after that.  The process is more important than the outcome. I like to stay in the present and enjoy the process. Let the outcome happen by the hard work you put into the process.   Yes, my next role in life will be bigger than my first.</p>
<p>Question: roll a video of a girl inspired by Abbie.  (the interviewer&#8217;s video of his two year old)  Do you stop and think about the reach you now have?</p>
<p>Answer: No, not really. My source of what I do is internal. The whole goal is to have a purpose internally.  My authenticity is my saving grace in life.  Love me or hate me I don&#8217;t really care.</p>
<p>Question: I had a conversation with your friend Julie Fowdy.  She&#8217;s so enthusiastic.  She&#8217;s taking herself and bringing herself down just a notch.</p>
<p>Answer: It takes a plan and putting the talk into action.   There are massive issues that have to be tackled.  Someone has to stand up and do the work. I&#8217;m ready for it.</p>
<p>Question: would you ever go into broadcasting?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, I just signed a deal with ESPN. It should be fun. I&#8217;m kind of in a year of saying yes.  I have to figure out what I like and don&#8217;t like.</p>
<p>Question: Working out isn&#8217;t a priority. What sport?</p>
<p>Answer: Golf. It&#8217;s a competition with yourself.</p>
<p>End: do something with a soccer ball.  Lots of headers.</p>
<h2>Cirque Du Soleil, Alma Derrick VP</h2>
<p>Question: you did something a lot of kids dream of. You ran away to the circus</p>
<p>Answer; The circus finds you. I was hooked a kids. Cirque is now 30 years old. We are undergoing a new transformation.  We are now owned by TPG.  It&#8217;s a chance to ask all the questions. From a business side, everything is back on the table.  Our brand is incredible on the stage.  But beyond that we are challenged.</p>
<p>Question: Let&#8217;s talk about experience.  Your product is experience.  How do you think about experience?</p>
<p>Answer: Our product doesn&#8217;t translate to any other media. It&#8217;s just not the same on TV.  I think we are in the right place with that.  We are challenged in selling the concept of the show itself.  The most radical thing we can do is to be more intimate.</p>
<p>Question: you are exposing the inside or the inner workings.</p>
<p>Answer: Exactly.  They want to  know more about our performers and behind the scenes.   it&#8217;s about turning the volume down and telling stories in a way that&#8217;s really different for us.</p>
<p>Question: Consumer expectations continue to rise.  But you are here to promote that with the next show. Does that work against you?</p>
<p>Answer: Not on stage.  Once we get people into the stage. But we certainly are expected to not do anything that&#8217;s normal.  Some things we do in marketing are not spectacular though.</p>
<p>Question: you do have an incredible brand.  Recently you&#8217;ve started to stretch the brand.</p>
<p>Answer: one of the things with intimacy. How do you break the show into it&#8217;s component parts.  We have set designers, dancers, set designers etc.  Cirque shops are the first step. The first was around dance.   The idea came from one of our dancers in Beetles Loved.  She brought a lot of insights to the table.  There are 75 dance studios. There&#8217;s space for us to do these master classes for a half-day.  It&#8217;s a different way to experience it.</p>
<p>Question: let&#8217;s talk about teams.  How does Cirque thing about themes</p>
<p>Answer: One of the most interesting things I learned at Cirque.  In the traditional circus. The trapeze artists are all one family.  They would build the set and strap everyone in.   What Cirque did is to bring technology and rigor.  The rigor is now an engineer.  Trust is more than just the family now.</p>
<p>Question: You take corporate teams in Spark session to learn about this team work.</p>
<p>Answer: We created Spark sessions to come out of your everyday existence and learn about this in a new context.</p>
<p>Question: What&#8217;s the next thing on your mind</p>
<p>Answer: It&#8217;s the high and the low. On any given day we have about 20,000 tickets to market.  We also have to think about how to make this a more intimate experience.</p>
<h2>George Clooney</h2>
<p>Actor, Producer, and Humanitarian. Interviewed by Anne Lewness, CMO Adobe</p>
<p>Question: You grew up in KY. You did TV. Became a film star. At this point in your career, what do you want to do.</p>
<p>Answer: Most of your career you were just taking a job.  I almost destroyed the Batman Franchise.  But it was cool at that point.  When you are lucky enough to get choices then you want to do things you would like to see.  I try to do the ones that wouldn&#8217;t get made unless you were there.</p>
<p>Question: So many movies and types. There was a quote, &#8220;It was a total waste of money&#8221;</p>
<p>Answer: I may not have said that but I will say it was a bad film and I did bad in it. I&#8217;ve been in some pretty crappy movies that did quite well.</p>
<p>Question: You&#8217;ve won Oscars, are famous. How do you measure success</p>
<p>Answer: Success is a weird thing and it&#8217;s all subjective. You just need to keep working and not try to measure your own success.  My thought is that whatever I&#8217;m doing next is the thing I&#8217;m most interested in.  It&#8217;s not helpful to go into your award room. I&#8217;ll judge success in my 80&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Question:You once said, &#8220;I think anyone who&#8217;s famous is moron if they are on twitter&#8221;</p>
<p>Answer: Yep, I said that!  Let me give you context around that.  I do think that if you are well known there is only a downside to it. I can get in a lot of trouble on twitter.  Speed can kill you in these kinds of situations.  I&#8217;m certainly capable of stupid things.</p>
<p>Question: If your aren&#8217;t in social media, how do you connect with fans and get feedback.</p>
<p>Answer: I&#8217;d rather meet people in person. There are too much electronics.  There&#8217;s a time for electronics but think about it.</p>
<p>Question: The reviewers of movies today are the viewers</p>
<p>Answer: Yes that&#8217;s true. Although small movies need a professional reviewer. You can&#8217;t &#8220;steal the weekend&#8221; anymore with good trailers and no reviewers.</p>
<p>Question: Technology has changed film making and distribution.  Adobe has a part in that.  How do you feel when you see someone watching your movies on a tablet or phone?</p>
<p>Answer: What&#8217;s happening in our industry is interesting.  TV for a long time had it&#8217;s limitation.  Now TV, Netflix, etc has put up the quality.  It&#8217;s better than some of the films you see.  It&#8217;s miraculous. It&#8217;s great for our industry in general.  It opens up so many avenues in the entertainment industry.  There&#8217;s 5X more work because of that.</p>
<p>Question: it&#8217;s the democratization of film making.</p>
<p>Answer: Remember that as we get older, we&#8217;ve seen pretty much every story ever made.  The new book is filtered to the same story we&#8217;ve seen so much.  But now you can make a movie from a young person on an iphone. It&#8217;s opening up storytelling again.</p>
<p>Question: New topic. You have a bit of  reputation as a prankster. Tell us.</p>
<p>Answer: There are a couple people who are favorite targets. I do horrible things to Richard ?? Brad Pitt is fun. He&#8217;s mean when he comes back.  When doing Ocean&#8217;s. He&#8217;d gotten a prius. I got a bumper that said &#8220;F&#8221; cops.   There&#8217;s no way he&#8217;s not getting arrested.  I got stationary made up with Brad&#8217;s name.  I then sent letters to actors from Brad.  Hilarity ensued.</p>
<p>Question: Do you think you are getting better with age?</p>
<p>Answer; No, I&#8217;m getting older. Most everything is worse with age.  I suppose the only thing is the idea that you are infinitely more comfortable with things. You are more patient. You have a much better sense of humor about yourself.</p>
<p>Question: At Adobe we believe it&#8217;s important to give back.  Silicon Valley hasn&#8217;t been as good about that. You said once that Hollywood reacts rather than leads when it comes to the important things.</p>
<p>Answer: I believe it but it was out of context.  That said, we look to leaders. I grew up in a time where you were expected to participate in the conversation.  In the US, by and large they are charitable. It&#8217;s hard to do the same outside the US.  It&#8217;s a generous country. I feel that our position has to be what can I do more.   it&#8217;s smaller groups that take responsibility and make change.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s the second day of Adobe Summit and the second general session focused more on the personal side of the Experience Wave Adobe highlighted on the first day.</p>
<p>John Mellor, VP Strategy and Business Development, began the session. He introduced Donny Osmond to start.</p>
<p>John and the audience sang a song from Mulan.  The concept: we all crave experiences.  In order to give those experiences to our customers, we have to get outside our comfort zone.</p>
<p>Data is just a piece of the puzzle.  We all &#8220;love&#8217; data.  Some are actual data nerds.  But data alone is useless without context and meaning. Data is sterile, without emotion.  It&#8217;s our job to add meaning.  The human element, the story, adds the experience.</p>
<p>Example: Eiffel tower. 81 stores, 18,000 parts. 2.5 million rivets.  Once you&#8217;ve been to the Eiffel Tower then you have a story.  You remember who you were with, how crowded it was, etc.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s about Data Driven Storytelling.<span id="more-3201"></span></p>
<p>Some key stats</p>
<p>Rate your Adobe Marketing Cloud Skills</p>
<ul>
<li>rookie: 27%</li>
<li>I&#8217;ve got skills 43%</li>
<li>All Start 30%</li>
</ul>
<p>How quickly does your organization adapt to the pace of change</p>
<ul>
<li>We&#8217;re lost 20%</li>
<li>Slow and steady 40+%</li>
<li>On fire: the rest</li>
</ul>
<p>The stats tell a story. We have a lot to do. There are a lot of challenges getting everyone on board.  But we are optimistic about getting the job done.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h2>Mattel President and COO Richard Dixon</h2>
<p>Reinventing the creations company. Mattel&#8217;s story.</p>
<p>Brands; Barbie, American Girl, How Wheels, Fisher Price, etc.</p>
<p>1976: Donny Osmond Fashion Doll. Big hit</p>
<p>2016: Abbie Wambach (US Soccer player)</p>
<p>Mattel has a story in progress in three chapters. It&#8217;s a transformation in progress.</p>
<h3>Chapter One: History</h3>
<p>Founders in 1945 thought of themselves as a creations company. The founders were designers and inventers. They came from a California garage.  The big thing to come from the garage wasn&#8217;t a toy, it was a mind set about bold risks.  They transformed a simple paper fashion doll  into Barbie. They transformed the simple car into Hot Wheels.</p>
<p>The founders bet everything on a new medium, television. They engaged kids with brands long before anyone talked about content strategy.  They formed a partnership with Walt Disney.  In that time, they grew but retained the creator mind set. Think of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Magic 8 ball</li>
<li>Cabbage patch dolls</li>
<li>Othello</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Btu at one point, they lost track of everything. Play was lost and imprisoned in child development.  Everyone was competing for time and the world evolved into an omni-channel universe.  Mattel repeated what worked instead of fearing the status quo.</p>
<p>Mattel suffered. The brands lost relevance.</p>
<h2>Chapter Two: Reinvention</h2>
<p>The roadmap</p>
<ul>
<li>Question evertyhing</li>
<li>Embrace uncertainty</li>
<li>Put results before process</li>
<li>Breakdown process to collaborate</li>
</ul>
<p>First up Barbie. It was the biggest brand challenge.  Barbie had lost it&#8217;s purpose. They listened to Mom, kids, and culture. Girls needed to love Barbie and Mom&#8217;s needed to like her again. Key changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Diversity revolution. 20 new Barbies</li>
<li>Flexible foot (It liberated Barbie from high heels)</li>
<li>Talk back Barbie. Make her talk</li>
<li>Reframed the conversation:
<ul>
<li>Showed key commercial with a girl  as professor.</li>
<li>With a girl as the vet</li>
<li>Soccer coach</li>
<li>Exec</li>
<li>Museum guide</li>
<li>then segway to a girl playing the same situations with Barbies</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Results:</p>
<ul>
<li>50 M views</li>
<li>500M engagements on FB and twitter</li>
<li>81% positive reactions</li>
<li>Trending topic on Yahoo with the new body types</li>
<li>and lots of important people tweeting they like it</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3203" src="/adobe-blog/files/2016/03/Mattel.png" alt="Mattel" width="572" height="500" srcset="/adobe-blog/files/2016/03/Mattel.png 572w, /adobe-blog/files/2016/03/Mattel-300x262.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 572px) 100vw, 572px" /></p>
<h3>Chapter Three</h3>
<p>Now talking about the toy box.</p>
<ul>
<li>They re-invented the View Master. In partnership with Google, they created a virtual reality learning tool.</li>
<li>Fisher Price re-invented. Code-a-pillar.  It can be re-assembled.</li>
<li>New high chair that can be easily disassembled and cleaned in the dishwasher</li>
<li>Thingmaker reinvented.  It&#8217;s now a 3D machine. You can create and print a range of items.</li>
<li>Hot Wheels: Star wards storm trooper car,  Encouraging boys to be more imaginative.  Create on your own. Kits with lots of hacks (OK I wish I had that growing up)</li>
</ul>
<p>Next big leap?</p>
<p>Will re-establish themselves as a creations company. It&#8217;s a child development company like no others.  Focused on pre-teen.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lots of excitement during the first full day of Adobe Summit 2016! Was it just me, or did your brain feel like it couldn’t hold any more information at the end of the day?</p>
<p>Among 10,000+ Summit attendees, I was blown away by the announcements and demos during the General Session. Here are the highlights, in case you missed the livestream or didn’t follow along on Twitter:</p>
<p><strong>“This is the Experience Era.”</strong></p>
<p>This eloquently sums up the opening remarks made by Shantanu Narayen, CEO of Adobe. According to Narayen, experiences will be the competitive differentiator for businesses. Experiences start with great content and are powered by data.</p>
<div id="attachment_3190" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="/adobe-blog/files/2016/03/AdobeSummit_BradRencher_Experience_Photo.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-3190"><img class="wp-image-3190 size-medium" src="/adobe-blog/files/2016/03/AdobeSummit_BradRencher_Experience_Photo-300x169.jpg" alt="AdobeSummit_BradRencher_Experience_Photo" width="300" height="169" srcset="/adobe-blog/files/2016/03/AdobeSummit_BradRencher_Experience_Photo-300x169.jpg 300w, /adobe-blog/files/2016/03/AdobeSummit_BradRencher_Experience_Photo.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo by Beth Martin, @betz826</p></div>
<p>Brad Rencher, Executive Vice President of Adobe, echoed this in his talk: “We’re in the third wave of digital transformation for the enterprise, and it’s about the consumer experience.”</p>
<p>He talked about the four success factors for creating great experiences:</p>
<ol>
<li>Know and respect me</li>
<li>Speak in one voice</li>
<li>Make technology transparent</li>
<li>Delight me at every turn</li>
</ol>
<p><span id="more-3189"></span>Rencher also said, “The experience wave is about goosebumps, smiles, and bringing people closer together. It’s the marketer’s job to close the gap between people and the things they want. Then get out of the way.”</p>
<p><strong>McDonald’s Embraces the Experience-Led Business</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_3191" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="/adobe-blog/files/2016/03/Adobe-Summit_McDonalds.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-3191"><img class="wp-image-3191 size-medium" src="/adobe-blog/files/2016/03/Adobe-Summit_McDonalds-300x225.jpg" alt="Adobe Summit_McDonalds" width="300" height="225" srcset="/adobe-blog/files/2016/03/Adobe-Summit_McDonalds-300x225.jpg 300w, /adobe-blog/files/2016/03/Adobe-Summit_McDonalds.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo by Alexander Hopstein, @Digit_Alex</p></div>
<p>Did you ever wonder why McDonald’s started offering breakfast all day? During Rencher’s engaging discussion with Deborah Wahl, CMO of McDonald’s, we learned that the customer was at the heart of this decision.</p>
<p>And when it came to embracing digital in their business model, such as the McDonald’s app or ordering food using a kiosk, Wahl had this to say:</p>
<p>“In digital, there are a lot of shiny toys. We had to focus on timing and balance to get the experience right. We identified the biggest customer need first and provided offers before embracing the ‘shiny objects.’”</p>
<p>McDonald’s mobile app launch mid-year in 2015, and since then, the business has already seen 10 million downloads.</p>
<p>“We’re on a quick journey to be in line with our customer,” Wahl stated.</p>
<p><strong>Order Dunkin Donuts from Your Tesla</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_3193" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="/adobe-blog/files/2016/03/AdobeSummit_DunkinDonuts_Order_Tesla.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-3193"><img class="wp-image-3193 size-medium" src="/adobe-blog/files/2016/03/AdobeSummit_DunkinDonuts_Order_Tesla-300x225.jpg" alt="AdobeSummit_DunkinDonuts_Order_Tesla" width="300" height="225" srcset="/adobe-blog/files/2016/03/AdobeSummit_DunkinDonuts_Order_Tesla-300x225.jpg 300w, /adobe-blog/files/2016/03/AdobeSummit_DunkinDonuts_Order_Tesla.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo by Jay Baer, @jaybaer</p></div>
<p>In the final segment of the General Session, David Nuescheler, VP of Enterprise Technology at Adobe, demonstrated the possibilities of connecting mobile technology in the physical world.</p>
<p>From using your smartphone – with your purchase preferences – to click and confirm your order at a with a Dunkin Donuts kiosk…</p>
<p>To placing your drive-thru order using your in-car connection – even a Tesla!</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to what’s in store for Day 2, and I would love to know what stood out to you among all the information shared during Day 1.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tamara Gaffney, Principal Analyst Adobe Digital Index and R&#8221;Ray&#8221; Wang, Principal Analyst of Constellation research were ready to make predictions with their big data crystal ball. They took on a variety of topics&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.. all digital marketing related of course.</p>
<p>Note: Big Data refers to the variety of events in the Marketing Cloud including Adobe Analytics.</p>
<p><strong>Looking back:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>in 2015 smartphone visits were up (No duh! right)</li>
<li>Media and entertain ment has a 36.6% uptick</li>
<li>Financial Services up 14.7%</li>
<li>Engagement and converston are still suffering
<ul>
<li>going down on smartphones and desktops</li>
<li>Conversion rates on smartphones are less than half of desktop</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Where are they going</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Tablets have flatlined but no more decline</li>
<li>Smartphones continue to go up. 7% in Jan 2012 to 29% in Jan 2016</li>
<li>Mobile OS visits are stable
<ul>
<li>approx 55% iOS</li>
<li>45% Android slight creep up</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Prediction:</strong> Tablets will come back at some point in time&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.in the form of flexible screens</p>
<p>Screen size will continue to shift.  Don&#8217;t count on this remaining the same</p>
<p><strong>Prediction:</strong> sales and traffic will creep back towards Android.  The Apple trade-in program is bad for Apple pass along use.  Also, Apple is starting to go down market and that has an impact.</p>
<p><span id="more-3175"></span></p>
<p><strong>App World</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There is a steep drop off in app launches</li>
<li>Media, Finance, and Shopping are down
<ul>
<li>Hard to keep these apps in use.</li>
<li>Users have app overload</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Many apps are not just mobile. Many are wifi mode. Media streaming for example</li>
<li>Shopping and Finance have more of a a mobile and smartphone set of use cases</li>
<li>Use cases drive this.  Content consumers spend more time. Transactions take less time</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Prediction</strong>: Biometric authentication will overtake passwords by 2020. This is selfie, heartbeat, fingerprint.  Note: they don&#8217;t take into account privacy law that takes biometrics to NOT be a warrant needy tool.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile Musts for marketers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Mobile is more than a device. It&#8217;s about designing experiences in motion</li>
<li>Make your app easy to authenticate across multiple channel</li>
<li>Think about channel ubiquity or what we call scenes and settings not omni-channel</li>
<li>Study what&#8217;s going on what&#8217;s going on in your Android and iOS base. You will see some interesting shifts including with Android and Samsung Pay</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Search is a crutch for users
<ul>
<li>on mobile devices, there is 76% growth in search. It&#8217;s a &#8220;I hate typing&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>More traffic is going mobile but&#8230;&#8230;. that traffic is not worth as much to you
<ul>
<li>Revenue per visit for mobile was only 50 cents per visit.  So a smart phone is worth 41% less to Google</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Adertising world is throwing more ads on pages&#8230;&#8230; yes we have all seen it</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Prediction:</strong> By Gen Z awareness building marketing will be over.  It&#8217;s a millenial backlash against advertising messing up navigation on mobile. Ray noted that 12 and younger are trained to ignore the ads.</p>
<p>The advertising industry will need to figure out how to make ads count.  Ad bundling may help offset that.</p>
<p><strong>Voice</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Voice rocks our world</li>
<li>Share of digital anticpation
<ul>
<li>Google now 5%
<ul>
<li>Tamara doesn&#8217;t think Google in is the catbird seat.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Windows cortana 5%</li>
<li>Siri 5% Amazon</li>
<li>Echo 2% (most admired btw)</li>
<li>Facebook M 20%
<ul>
<li>Facebook volume has gone up.  People in the 30-50 demographic are going back to Facebook</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This is an open battleground</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advertising Play</strong></p>
<p>Awareness must tie back to brand promise</p>
<p><strong>Future of Entertainment</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>TV everywhere has pickdd up.  17.4%</li>
<li>But kids are at 83% in Teens and Toons genre
<ul>
<li>This is quarter over quarter growth</li>
<li>Kids are watching youtube videos</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Live TV other than sports and election coverage is dead</li>
<li>What are they using to watch tv
<ul>
<li>Apple TV is winning at 10%</li>
<li>But Roku is growing faster.  Roku put out a hi-definition box</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gaming is huge
<ul>
<li>League of legends MOBA is bigger than all other sports</li>
<li>Kids like to watch videos of games being played</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Kids are content consumers and creators
<ul>
<li>They want more content faster</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Prediction:</strong> Android OS TV&#8217;s will cut into Apple TV. It will change the game yet again.  Multi-channel will help drive this.  (Move from phone to home to travel)</p>
<p><strong>Prediction:</strong> Context will be your new mantra.  It&#8217;s about engaging correctly where they are</p>
<p>If you put together these then you&#8217;ve  got good context</p>
<ol>
<li>Identity</li>
<li>Time</li>
<li>Location</li>
<li>Weather</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What to do</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Get a gaming strategy</li>
<li>Gaming is the new advertising opportunity</li>
<li>Expect a convergence of mobile and tv operating systems to shift engagement and consumptiong</li>
<li>Contextually relevant content is the future</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Future of &#8220;Stuff&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Showed a video. With content everywhere, there will be no channel.  You will surface content and apps in windows, stove tops, cars, walls, etc.</p>
<p>Internet of things received with joyful anticipation</p>
<ul>
<li>35% are looking forward to the IoT with smart devices interacting more contextually</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Prediction:</strong> IoT will become mission critical</p>
<p><strong>Prediction:</strong> IoT rollercoaster reaches a peak then takes a steep dive.  Nest with huge bakloas over product outage with baby monitors.  High tech cars facing greater reliability challenges.  See the drone wars.</p>
<p><strong>Prediction</strong>: Bandwidth becomes a public utility.  Bandwidth demand will increase but providers are losing revenue. Prices for bandwidth will go up.  Content delivery and time may change.</p>
<p><strong>Augmented and Virtual Reality</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Oculus Rift was a big thing at South By Southwest
<ul>
<li>Still won&#8217;t come out for a bit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In Utah, they opened a virtual reality gaming place called the void
<ul>
<li>Showed a promo video (below)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Prediction</strong>: VR impacts B2B, healthcare, and gaming first.</p>
<p>How to think about IoT</p>
<ul>
<li>With iot think about scenes and settings and not channels</li>
<li>Value is the contextual insights to make better recommendations</li>
<li>AR and VR have both active and passive approaches to transform experience</li>
<li>Connectivity requires intention driven approach</li>
</ul>
<h3>What else?</h3>
<p>Marketers cannot reassemble fractured identities on your own.  Customers have on average 7.2 devices but on average, a given site only sees 1.2 devices per month in logged in mode.</p>
<p>Prediction: 2016 will be your year of identity.  You want to map experiences and journeys. Identity allows it and users may allow you that information for the convenience. Of course, the battle for identity is everywhere. They all want a piece of your identity or owning that authentication.</p>

<h3>RBS Head of Analytics Gile Richardson</h3>
<p>Let me tell you about a program called superstar DJ&#8217;s. We wanted this to be a customer focused data driven slice of awesomeness.</p>
<p>About RBS: 25 million global customers with assets of $1.7 trillion.  Aim is to be the number 1 bank in the UI for service, advocacy and trust.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t always the case the RBS managed their experiences. &#8220;We were terrible&#8221;   it was a firework culture.  Light up a new experience and launch it.  The changes were made by gut feel and included a long backlog  but they didn&#8217;t have enough data and weren&#8217;t looking at it.   Reports were in text. It was hard to find meaningfull patterns in the data.</p>
<p>How do you become Superstar DJ&#8217;s</p>
<ul>
<li>First, look at the journey.  They divided the digital team into journey managers throughout the customer lifecycle</li>
<li>Chose a CMS in AEM</li>
<li>Implemented tag management for a single view of the entire journey
<ul>
<li>DTM</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Democratize the data 110 live data dashboards
<ul>
<li>Used Adobe analytics for all the journey managers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Begin optimization
<ul>
<li>but how to manage the resource issue</li>
<li>The answer is that it&#8217;s for everyone.  Everyone needed to do it.</li>
<li>Gave them the tools, training, and support to do it.</li>
<li>Began a nice cycle
<ul>
<li>Learn</li>
<li>Collaborate for change
<ul>
<li>Worked with producers</li>
<li>Do all the changes in the marketing cloud</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Test it
<ul>
<li>No change goes online without it being tested first</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How did this work?
<ul>
<li>Made it fun</li>
<li>Maxed out the music theme with the team</li>
<li>Used billboard charts</li>
<li>promoted healthy competition</li>
<li>Got the entire team on board</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Highlighted the NatWest site
<ul>
<li>Mobile and legacy experience</li>
<li>Highlighted new product with the reward account</li>
<li>Showed a real time cross device stitching of an experience
<ul>
<li>Also highlighted key messages in the reward account</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Numbers
<ul>
<li>H1 2014 did 2 tests</li>
<li>2015 did 400 tests</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Last thoughts;
<ul>
<li>Be fearless. experiment and pull back if it doesn&#8217;t work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Quote</strong>: We are a 300 year old bank and are proud of our history. But we are more concerned about the last 10 seconds of our customer experience online.</p>
<h3>Adobe Data Science Magic</h3>
<p>Are adding several</p>
<ul>
<li>Virtual analyst</li>
<li>Asset auto-tagging</li>
<li>Advertising insights</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li>Predictive Subject Lines</li>
</ul>
<h3>Key New Announcements</h3>
<h4>Adobe Co-op</h4>
<p>Problem: we market to devices.  It&#8217;s not to people.  It&#8217;s a blind spot when your typical use had 3-7 devices.</p>
<p><strong>New product:</strong> the Adobe Marketing Cloud Device Co-op.  Looking for your participation.</p>
<p>The power of a login is the key to this.  An average brand can only link 10% of interactions with a login.  The Co-op extends what you know about a customer to more.</p>
<p>By focusing  on people, you can better allocate your spend.   The co-op will be integrated into analytics.  The device cop-op will also let you know about additional devices for people..  Tracking people and not devices, lets you better target your user using that context.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy</strong>: Does this without sharing personal data and includes an opt-out.</p>
<p>Will be rolling the Co-op out to more customers over the coming year.  Talk to your Adobe Rep.</p>
<h4>Availability of Adobe.io Developer Portal</h4>
<p>Just rolling out the portal</p>
<h4>Adobe Exchange program for marketing cloud</h4>
<p>Get better access to technology and innovate</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Mobile Experiences</h4>
<p>Mobile has become how you engage with your brand.  Recently announced at Mobile World Congress some key new functionality</p>
<p>Demo</p>
<ul>
<li>Did a search on mobile on bike helmets</li>
<li>Saw an REI ad and clicked on it</li>
<li>Invited to install the mobile app</li>
<li>Installed it
<ul>
<li>Note: now to correctly assign attribution across the install</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After launching the installed app, allowed Geo tracking
<ul>
<li>and were immediately shown the helmet section</li>
<li>This is deferred deep-linking and gave a continuous experience for the user</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Then showed a push message to show e nearby store
<ul>
<li>Can draw a geo-fence around a location</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Walked towards the store. The app then showed the smart bag</li>
<li>The bag is an IoT device. It has bluetooth and RFID
<ul>
<li>Paired the phone by bumping the bag.</li>
<li>Added product to the bag and automatically added it to the cart</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Walked away and checked out the user with a complete transaction
<ul>
<li>Note: go see the immersive retail experience on the show floor</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Scale</h4>
<p>it&#8217;s about Data and Speed.  Marketers don&#8217;t have a clear view of what&#8217;s important.</p>
<p>New Capabilties</p>
<ul>
<li>Segment comparison
<ul>
<li>Bring 3rd party data to audience manager. Now you can reports on that information as well</li>
<li>Can compare segments and with more dimensions</li>
<li>In demo, showed a lost cart.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can take the lost cart and react in real time
<ul>
<li>Can put a number of triggers on the site</li>
<li>Demo: Las Vegas event trigger and focus on the most loyal customers and frequency on the trigger fire</li>
<li>This trigger led to an email to the lost cart user.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Deadpool and their social campaign with an irreverent tone.  It led to a huge grossing film</li>
<li>Mastercard started their Priceless surprises campaign in digital form</li>
<li>Digital Experience has made it easy to book your theme park vacation</li>
<li>Retail digital experiences continually make it easier to</li>
<li>Shantanu booked a ticket to the last Kobe Bryant game all online flights, hotel, ticket.</li>
</ul>
<p>Digital experiences need to be provocative and predictive.</p>
<p><strong>Quote:</strong> This is the experience era</p>
<p>Experiences are the basis for new competition.</p>
<p><strong>Quote:</strong> No one wants to be disrupted by an upstart with a better solution</p>
<p>Experiences and the technology to deliver it has become more important.  Now it&#8217;s about using data to create that exeprience.</p>
<p><span id="more-3166"></span></p>
<p>Adobe organizes itself:</p>
<ol>
<li>Digital Media (Creative Cloud)</li>
<li>Digital Document (Adobe Document Cloud)</li>
<li>Digital Marketing (Adobe Marketing Cloud)</li>
<li>(anyone see a theme going on?)</li>
</ol>
<p>Shantanu then went on to talk about how these three clouds will become part of the Adobe.core platform. It will be part of a larger ecosystem.  Think about what that means btw.  This is n&#8217;t just integrating Marketing Cloud but integrating it all.</p>
<p><strong>Adobe</strong> <strong>Mission</strong>: Changing the world through digital experiences</p>
<h2>Brad Rencher: EVP and GM Digital Marketing</h2>
<p>Summit Data:</p>
<ul>
<li>The entire C Suite is in the room</li>
<li>Data scientists</li>
<li>Architects</li>
<li>Manager</li>
<li>Developers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Quote</strong>: Digital Marketing is not about Adobe, you, your partners. It&#8217;s about PEOPE</p>
<p><strong>Quote</strong>: Marketers are caretakers of the customer experience</p>
<p>The need to understand data and to &#8220;know&#8221; your customers is becoming more challenging.  it&#8217;s the internet of things.  Customers want the experience to be consistent, continuous, and compelling.  Enterprises will be forced to transform in ways they haven&#8217;t needed to for decades. It will change how you do what you do.</p>
<p>This enterprise disruption is the third:</p>
<ol>
<li>Back office wave: manufacturing processes, six sigma, paper forms in to do boxes
<ol>
<li>How do we implement and train these employees to use them.</li>
<li>ERP was a key component of this&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.although it&#8217;s no longer a differentiator.  It&#8217;s table stakes</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Front office wave: Replace the rolodex with CRM.
<ol>
<li>Now CRM is ubiquitous</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Experience business wave: it also spawns from new technology but has one key difference
<ol>
<li>It&#8217;s not about the company. It&#8217;s about the consumer. It&#8217;s about create a great experience</li>
<li>It&#8217;s about nothing: do you job so well that it&#8217;s seamless and you, the company, don&#8217;t exist</li>
<li>It also means that the entire organization are stewards of the experience</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The Experience Business Wave is the new competitive battleground. It&#8217;s democratic. Everyone has a voice.</p>
<p>In 15 years, over half the Fortune 500 has turned over.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Are you an Experience Business?</p>
<p>Key components of an Experience Business</p>
<ol>
<li>Know me and respect me</li>
<li>Speak to me in one voice; always in context</li>
<li>Make technology transparent. the medium is not the message, the experience is.</li>
<li>Delight me at every turn: it disrupts itself</li>
</ol>
<p>Take Moore&#8217;s law in technology.  The law of experience says that a customers expectation of experience will double every year. Take some good examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>Delta: they know me from when I book a ticket to my flight</li>
<li>HBO Go: consume my content where I want</li>
<li>McDonalds and all day breakfast</li>
</ol>
<h2>Deborah Wahl: SVP and CMO McDonalds</h2>
<p>Question: what have you been working on</p>
<p>Answer: We have been working on changing all aspects of the customer experience. It&#8217;s food, brand value, etc.  We brought in fresh cracked eggs, fresh chicken, and a host of other changes including all day breakfast.  We ended 2015 as the second highest performing stock and had our largest Q4 profit in history</p>
<p>Question: All day breakfast did that?</p>
<p>Answer: the best fast food hack in history is the hamburger and the Egg McMuffing</p>
<p>Question: talk to us about the brand transformation</p>
<p>Answer: The big transformation is on the digital side. We started investing in digital.  We knew we had to go from Mass to Mass Personalization. We have a lot more work to do.  18 months ago we didn&#8217;t have an app, we had only one way to order, response times were in the hours.</p>
<p>Now we are at a response time in minutes. We now have an app. We are more aligned with our customer.</p>
<p>After 25 years in marketing it&#8217;s still changing every day</p>
<p>Question: the product is pretty analog and will remain that way for a while.  How do you blend digital and analog</p>
<p>Answer: We have to deliver on expectations and giving a consistent brand experience.  The best way to deliver the convenience is to follow what the customers are saying.  McDonalds customers wanted offers as their number one ask.</p>
<p>Question: How do you deal with scale.  In the US you are talking about 26 million customers every day</p>
<p>Answer: In digital there are a lot of shiny toys. We had to step back and focus on timing and balance.  We did mobile pay.  But we have to think about scale. We have a mention in social every 1.5 seconds.  We have to take that into account.  Figure out what you can do first. Solve the priority.  That takes a lot of discipline.</p>
<p>Question: How is the Hamburgler dealing with all this change?</p>
<p>Answer: He grew up. He&#8217;s hot and cool now. He&#8217;s digitally savvy.</p>
<p>Question: What are emerging trends you are thinking about embracing</p>
<p>Answer: We created a virtual reality happy meal box at South by Southwest. You could play paintball in the happy meal.  In Sweden, they did a thing on virtual reality glasses.  We are looking at partnering with Ford.</p>
<p>Look at the day to day.  It&#8217;s about the big changes you can implement.  Take our wifi network.  In Texas, they love the local messaging. 350% increase in click throughs because of that.  The bigger gain comes from the very practical approach to building a business</p>
