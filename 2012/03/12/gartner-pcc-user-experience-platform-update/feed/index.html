		<description><![CDATA[. Though Centralpoint supports authentication with other systems, including LDAP/AD, we still believe the Members module is necessary. Think about this &#039; There are several different members to your site. Take for instance existing clients. You may want to authenticate existing clients with your client database through Global Login. But what about prospective clients? Those users, who are not actually clients yet, may want to sign up for newsletters or online benefits. Here, Centralpoint Members enable you to store their information until they become bona fide clients. In other scenarios, we may authenticate against LDAP/AD for your intranet, which allows us to welcome those users by Role and name, but where would we store their email newsletter preferences, for example? Centralpoint Members allow you to store information about your users safely and securely, while enabling you to serve each user in a personalized manner. I’m happy to share this information with users that are looking for SharePoint alternatives.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jason Kidd, We have been searching around the internet looking for a new SharePoint alternative with new User Experience. I’ve heard Google Apps has a really nice user experience and will cut us down in cost by a lot. Do you have a link to Centralpoint.  And how can Centalpoint cut cost Vs. Sharepoint?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I recently after years of experience with content management systems came across a system with the new User Experience Platform (UXP). I had been hearing about these new buzz word 
“UXP” in technology for some time. I really didn’t understand what it meant for my company or me. I did a quick Google and found out this new platform could easily create productive for us. We were using SharePoint but between the licensing, I.T. staff cost, and the fact that it didn’t have any real social capabilities made us search for a new CMSs fast.  
We found Centarlpoint by Oxcyon.
It is a smooth transition from
our old program because of the Data Transfer module, that allowed me to drive my old content right into the
Centralpoint CMS Portal with ease. That isn’t the only thing that is great about Centralpoint. They have over 230 modules
that have made things a lot easier.
It&#039;s more than just a content management system. I use; centralpoint offers role based filtration, email
broadcasting to update all the members, microsite management, multi-step workflow, and business intelligence. It is
all part of a centralized platform that makes it quite simple to use. Its easy.. not hard.]]></description>
