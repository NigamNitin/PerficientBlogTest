<h3>What do Mattel, Abby Wambach, Cirque Du Soleil, and George Clooney have in common?</h3>
<p>I’ll wait for you to Google it&#8230;<a href="/adobe-blog/files/2016/03/AdobeSummit_Day2_Mellor_Data.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-3225"><img class="alignright wp-image-3225 " src="/adobe-blog/files/2016/03/AdobeSummit_Day2_Mellor_Data-300x150.jpg" alt="AdobeSummit_Day2_Mellor_Data" width="466" height="233" srcset="/adobe-blog/files/2016/03/AdobeSummit_Day2_Mellor_Data-300x150.jpg 300w, /adobe-blog/files/2016/03/AdobeSummit_Day2_Mellor_Data-768x383.jpg 768w, /adobe-blog/files/2016/03/AdobeSummit_Day2_Mellor_Data-600x299.jpg 600w, /adobe-blog/files/2016/03/AdobeSummit_Day2_Mellor_Data.jpg 1023w" sizes="(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px" /></a> Did you come up with the answer?</p>
<p>According to John Mellor, Adobe’s VP of Strategy and Business Development, they all are boldly creative in a world driven by data. <strong>This is what’s required to make the transformation to an experience-led business.</strong></p>
<p>“Our jobs demand more data to create those experiences, but data is just a piece of the puzzle. Data alone is insufficient until we can wrap meaning around it. Our job is to transform that data into content that gives meaning to the experience,” he said.</p>
<p>Mellor also revealed results of a Twitter poll of Summit attendees, revealing that <strong>more than 40% believe their organization is “slow and steady”</strong> to adapt to this change of pace. Herein lies the challenge for many brands: combine data and science with content to tell great stories at scale.<span id="more-3223"></span></p>
<p>“It’s through the power of storytelling that you can create the experiences and personal connections we all crave,” Mellor stated.</p>
<p>While Mattel, Cirque du Soleil, Wambach, and Clooney all shared captivating stories, below are highlights from two of the talks.</p>
<p><strong>“Sometimes the most valuable invention is reinvention” </strong></p>
<p>For most of us, our connection to Mattel stems from our childhood. Whether you loved Barbie, Hot Wheels, Fisher Price, or American Girl, Mattel is etched in our memories.</p>
<p>Richard Dickson, President and COO of Mattel, shared the story of how the brand started as a creations company by transforming the traditional paper fashion dolls into Barbie dolls, and “reinventing the toy car as a cultural phenomenon.” (Hot Wheels)<a href="/adobe-blog/files/2016/03/Reinvention_Challenge_AdobeSummit.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-3230"><img class="wp-image-3230 alignright" src="/adobe-blog/files/2016/03/Reinvention_Challenge_AdobeSummit-300x150.jpg" alt="Reinvention_Challenge_AdobeSummit" width="426" height="213" srcset="/adobe-blog/files/2016/03/Reinvention_Challenge_AdobeSummit-300x150.jpg 300w, /adobe-blog/files/2016/03/Reinvention_Challenge_AdobeSummit-768x383.jpg 768w, /adobe-blog/files/2016/03/Reinvention_Challenge_AdobeSummit-600x299.jpg 600w, /adobe-blog/files/2016/03/Reinvention_Challenge_AdobeSummit.jpg 989w" sizes="(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px" /></a></p>
<p>However as the brand succeeded and the company grew, Mattel lost its way and devolved into a packaged goods company that made toys.</p>
<p>The company realized it had to challenge the status quo to rise as a leading brand in “playtime.” <strong>Mattel applied the reinvention roadmap to reboot Barbie and disrupt the category the founders established 60+ years ago.</strong></p>
<p>“Rapid relevance was the only way out,” Dickson said. Mattel did four major things for Barbie:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reflected the diversity girls see today, and launched more than 20 new dolls that represented a wide variety of skin tones, hair color and texture</li>
<li>Liberated Barbie from high heels with a flexible foot</li>
<li>Created “Hello Barbie,” one of the most advanced AI toys that engages girls with conversation (Note: this was created based on feedback from girls who said “I wish Barbie could talk to me.”)</li>
<li>Responded to decades of cultural criticism of Barbie&#8217;s “perfect body” by developing dolls that reflect a wide variety of body types</li>
</ol>
<p>Mattel needed to make girls fall in love with Barbie again and have their moms “like Barbie a little bit more.” This prompted the brand to create and tell a story through a short film called, “Imagine the possibilities”.</p>
<p>Mattel knew they had won over their audience before placing any paid advertising. They “created blockbuster relevance in the marketplace that couldn’t be bought,&#8221; with trending topics on Yahoo! and a cover story for Time as well as:</p>
<ul>
<li>50 million views of the short film</li>
<li>500 million engagements on Facebook and Twitter</li>
<li>81% positive reactions from moms</li>
<li>Celebrity influencers talking about it on social media</li>
</ul>
<p>This reinvention roadmap, which is now being applied to Hot Wheels, Fisher Price, and other lines, is the push for Mattel to re-establish itself as a creations company and inspire the wonder of childhood.</p>
<p><strong>Shaking Up the Movie Industry</strong></p>
<p><a href="/adobe-blog/files/2016/03/Clooney3_talk.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-3234"><img class=" wp-image-3234 alignright" src="/adobe-blog/files/2016/03/Clooney3_talk-300x211.jpg" alt="Clooney3_talk" width="372" height="262" srcset="/adobe-blog/files/2016/03/Clooney3_talk-300x211.jpg 300w, /adobe-blog/files/2016/03/Clooney3_talk-600x423.jpg 600w, /adobe-blog/files/2016/03/Clooney3_talk.jpg 698w" sizes="(max-width: 372px) 100vw, 372px" /></a>Day 2 closed with an interview of George Clooney by Ann Lewnes, senior vice president and CMO of Adobe. Among the many topics covered, they discussed the shift in the film industry due in part to emerging technologies and social media.</p>
<p>“Technology and new media are opening up new ways to tell stories that didn’t exist before,” Clooney said.</p>
<p>“What’s happening in our industry is interesting. Television, for a long time, had its limitations. But now, TV, Netflix and others have ramped up the quality. It’s better than some of the films you see, and that’s great for our industry in general,” he continued.</p>
<p>With the proliferation of smartphones and similar video capturing devices, anyone can create content and share their experience with a large audience on social media. While Clooney is not a fan of social media, he indicated one benefit (from his perspective): “It [social media] can force you to make better products.”</p>
<p>This shift is something not only with which Hollywood has to contend, but also across dozens of other industries. You can’t ignore your fans – or your haters for that matter.</p>
<p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>
<p>The keynote speakers of the day echoed John Mellor’s earlier remarks: “Storytelling is the biggest tool we have at our disposal. It’s that human touch that helps us connect with customers. Now, more than ever, we have to be storytellers.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dr. Tal  Schwartz of Clicktale and Arran Peck  from Ancestry.com discussed how they transformed their experience. He started with a video.</p>
<p>The Clicktale product pulls all the information about everything someone does on the site.  It&#8217;s an easy integration to the web site.  They also integrate to Adobe Analystics, Adobe Target, and Adobe Experience Manager. By getting these deep insights, you can use that to create better tests and more efficiently optimize your site.<img class="size-full wp-image-3216 alignleft" src="/adobe-blog/files/2016/03/clicktale-heat-map.jpeg" alt="clicktale-heat-map" width="253" height="199" /></p>
<p>AEM Integration</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a button on AEM site and you get a heat map to show you what users are doing on the site.</p>
<p>Many companies like CNN and Ancestry.com are using Clicktale</p>
<p>Mobile vs desktop: There are a number of use cases suited to mobile vs desktop.  In other words both have their place. Neither is going away.  That&#8217;s why Clicktale supports both channels.  You can get full session playback for a mobile site.  You also get a heat map for the mobile page.</p>
<h2>Ancestry&#8217;s Usage</h2>
<p>Arran has been with Ancestry.com for quite a while.  He ran the Australia office for a while but recently moved to the Bay Area.  He&#8217;s the senior director of conversion.<span id="more-3215"></span></p>
<p>Ancestry</p>
<ul>
<li>leading online family history service</li>
<li>Subscription allows you to access voer 2B document</li>
<li>leading DNA test for family history
<ul>
<li>Genotyped 1.5 M customers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>$680M revenue in 2015</li>
<li>1,300 employees</li>
<li>Offices in US, UK, Australia, Canada, and Sweden</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Conversion and Insights, a love story</strong></h3>
<p>A lot of Ancestry&#8217;s brand is about storytelling.  The story</p>
<ul>
<li>Uses Adobe Analytics to get data insights and see what opportunities exist</li>
<li>Create the hypothesis and then test it in Adobe Target</li>
<li>Use Tableau dashboards to see the data in Target and the actual revenue.
<ul>
<li>Business impact</li>
<li>Lifetime revenue</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>But were missing the customer insight.  Over 80% of the time, people were doing unexpected things.
<ul>
<li>Wanted to know why a test won and why a test lost</li>
<li>It&#8217;s about that true insight in actual usage</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Case Study 1</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3217" src="/adobe-blog/files/2016/03/ancestrydna-600x225.png" alt="ancestrydna" width="600" height="225" srcset="/adobe-blog/files/2016/03/ancestrydna-600x225.png 600w, /adobe-blog/files/2016/03/ancestrydna-300x112.png 300w, /adobe-blog/files/2016/03/ancestrydna-768x288.png 768w, /adobe-blog/files/2016/03/ancestrydna.png 1297w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Ancestry DNA is a simple $99 test to find your ethnic mix and uncover distant relatives.  This gives</p>
<ul>
<li>New audience</li>
<li>Significant increase in traffic to home page</li>
<li>But limited insight into customer behavior</li>
</ul>
<p>Ran a test on the Ancestry DNA page.  They wanted to find out about the impact to different sections.  The results were good with an overall increase in sales.  However, ClickTale showed that all the middle content had little engagement.  The bottom section for FAQ&#8217;s had 53 seconds, almost 3X the other sections.</p>
<p>Then changed the banner image from white male to Native American</p>
<h3>Case Study 2</h3>
<p>Iterative testing into a great experience.   This test was about onboarding.  They used a testing process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Think it</li>
<li>Test it</li>
<li>Build it</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=" wp-image-3218 alignleft" src="/adobe-blog/files/2016/03/ancestryfamilytree-529x600.png" alt="ancestryfamilytree" width="327" height="370" srcset="/adobe-blog/files/2016/03/ancestryfamilytree-529x600.png 529w, /adobe-blog/files/2016/03/ancestryfamilytree-265x300.png 265w, /adobe-blog/files/2016/03/ancestryfamilytree-300x340.png 300w, /adobe-blog/files/2016/03/ancestryfamilytree.png 584w" sizes="(max-width: 327px) 100vw, 327px" />So new functionality gets tested before rollout of functionality.   In this case, they wanted to make it really easy to run through your family tree.</p>
<p>Outcome:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase bill through of customers in free stage trial</li>
<li>Users more likely to bill through after the trial if they actually build their family tree</li>
<li>Quicker speed to discovery and to building a full product for A/B test validation (get product to release quicker)</li>
</ul>
<p>The process</p>
<ol>
<li>Setup four rounds of the experience</li>
<li>Look at the Clicktale videos</li>
<li>Build second prototype and test again
<ol>
<li>Also looked at if users were building trees quicker, etc.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>He showed how they were able to see the test results</li>
</ol>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Abbie Wombach holds the FIFA record for the most international goals among men and women soccer players. She&#8217;s also a two time Olympic Gold Medalist</p>
<p>Question: Since you retired you&#8217;ve been doing cool things</p>
<p>Answer: I&#8217;ve been pretty busy.  I traveled around the world talking to FIFA and CEO&#8217;s  I want to change the world.  There&#8217;s a need to positively impact your environment.  Get equal opportunity for everyone.  Let&#8217;s focus on more than a niche. Everyone deserves a shot to be treated equally</p>
<p>Question: You are an inspiration to millions worldwide.  The key is the inequality to the gap in pay.  That includes in soccer.  This gap and how people think about it.</p>
<p>Answer: 10-15 years ago the conversation would have been different with the recent comments of ??. Hr resigned today but that wouldn&#8217;t have happened   It means</p>
<p>Question: You won the world cup and made $2M for the team. Germany won last year and came back with $35M.<span id="more-3205"></span></p>
<p>Answer: Look at the data.  We had more viewership than any other event so it needs to be resolved.</p>
<p>Question: You have such a great brand as the womens team.</p>
<p>Answer: It gives me chills to see that happen. It&#8217;s great to see men, especially professional players to give that respect. It&#8217;s been a long time that it&#8217;s been earned.  We work to gain respect.</p>
<p>Question: You went to the Whitehouse and what did he call you</p>
<p>Answer: uh, he called me the greatest of all time</p>
<p>Question: you were the youngest of 7 kids. Was eating with a huge family ever a problem</p>
<p>Answer: Yeah, I eat too quickly because I had to compete for the food. You can see why I was able to build the body I was able to build.  Be proud of your body women. Having a huge family was really impactful.  Coming from somewhere is important. Those are the things that propel you. they are the dynamite in your shoes.  Use your past as a positive to push you forward.</p>
<p>Question: Adobe Summit, the theme is about experience. Your life is one experience after another.  You&#8217;ve had this amazing career which culminated in what most would make you the greatest women&#8217;s soccer player of all time. What&#8217; stands out.</p>
<p>Answer: loaded question.   It was winning the medals but more importantly it was the locker room after.  There&#8217;s nothing better than that. Then comes seeing your family after that.  The process is more important than the outcome. I like to stay in the present and enjoy the process. Let the outcome happen by the hard work you put into the process.   Yes, my next role in life will be bigger than my first.</p>
<p>Question: roll a video of a girl inspired by Abbie.  (the interviewer&#8217;s video of his two year old)  Do you stop and think about the reach you now have?</p>
<p>Answer: No, not really. My source of what I do is internal. The whole goal is to have a purpose internally.  My authenticity is my saving grace in life.  Love me or hate me I don&#8217;t really care.</p>
<p>Question: I had a conversation with your friend Julie Fowdy.  She&#8217;s so enthusiastic.  She&#8217;s taking herself and bringing herself down just a notch.</p>
<p>Answer: It takes a plan and putting the talk into action.   There are massive issues that have to be tackled.  Someone has to stand up and do the work. I&#8217;m ready for it.</p>
<p>Question: would you ever go into broadcasting?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, I just signed a deal with ESPN. It should be fun. I&#8217;m kind of in a year of saying yes.  I have to figure out what I like and don&#8217;t like.</p>
<p>Question: Working out isn&#8217;t a priority. What sport?</p>
<p>Answer: Golf. It&#8217;s a competition with yourself.</p>
<p>End: do something with a soccer ball.  Lots of headers.</p>
<h2>Cirque Du Soleil, Alma Derrick VP</h2>
<p>Question: you did something a lot of kids dream of. You ran away to the circus</p>
<p>Answer; The circus finds you. I was hooked a kids. Cirque is now 30 years old. We are undergoing a new transformation.  We are now owned by TPG.  It&#8217;s a chance to ask all the questions. From a business side, everything is back on the table.  Our brand is incredible on the stage.  But beyond that we are challenged.</p>
<p>Question: Let&#8217;s talk about experience.  Your product is experience.  How do you think about experience?</p>
<p>Answer: Our product doesn&#8217;t translate to any other media. It&#8217;s just not the same on TV.  I think we are in the right place with that.  We are challenged in selling the concept of the show itself.  The most radical thing we can do is to be more intimate.</p>
<p>Question: you are exposing the inside or the inner workings.</p>
<p>Answer: Exactly.  They want to  know more about our performers and behind the scenes.   it&#8217;s about turning the volume down and telling stories in a way that&#8217;s really different for us.</p>
<p>Question: Consumer expectations continue to rise.  But you are here to promote that with the next show. Does that work against you?</p>
<p>Answer: Not on stage.  Once we get people into the stage. But we certainly are expected to not do anything that&#8217;s normal.  Some things we do in marketing are not spectacular though.</p>
<p>Question: you do have an incredible brand.  Recently you&#8217;ve started to stretch the brand.</p>
<p>Answer: one of the things with intimacy. How do you break the show into it&#8217;s component parts.  We have set designers, dancers, set designers etc.  Cirque shops are the first step. The first was around dance.   The idea came from one of our dancers in Beetles Loved.  She brought a lot of insights to the table.  There are 75 dance studios. There&#8217;s space for us to do these master classes for a half-day.  It&#8217;s a different way to experience it.</p>
<p>Question: let&#8217;s talk about teams.  How does Cirque thing about themes</p>
<p>Answer: One of the most interesting things I learned at Cirque.  In the traditional circus. The trapeze artists are all one family.  They would build the set and strap everyone in.   What Cirque did is to bring technology and rigor.  The rigor is now an engineer.  Trust is more than just the family now.</p>
<p>Question: You take corporate teams in Spark session to learn about this team work.</p>
<p>Answer: We created Spark sessions to come out of your everyday existence and learn about this in a new context.</p>
<p>Question: What&#8217;s the next thing on your mind</p>
<p>Answer: It&#8217;s the high and the low. On any given day we have about 20,000 tickets to market.  We also have to think about how to make this a more intimate experience.</p>
<h2>George Clooney</h2>
<p>Actor, Producer, and Humanitarian. Interviewed by Anne Lewness, CMO Adobe</p>
<p>Question: You grew up in KY. You did TV. Became a film star. At this point in your career, what do you want to do.</p>
<p>Answer: Most of your career you were just taking a job.  I almost destroyed the Batman Franchise.  But it was cool at that point.  When you are lucky enough to get choices then you want to do things you would like to see.  I try to do the ones that wouldn&#8217;t get made unless you were there.</p>
<p>Question: So many movies and types. There was a quote, &#8220;It was a total waste of money&#8221;</p>
<p>Answer: I may not have said that but I will say it was a bad film and I did bad in it. I&#8217;ve been in some pretty crappy movies that did quite well.</p>
<p>Question: You&#8217;ve won Oscars, are famous. How do you measure success</p>
<p>Answer: Success is a weird thing and it&#8217;s all subjective. You just need to keep working and not try to measure your own success.  My thought is that whatever I&#8217;m doing next is the thing I&#8217;m most interested in.  It&#8217;s not helpful to go into your award room. I&#8217;ll judge success in my 80&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Question:You once said, &#8220;I think anyone who&#8217;s famous is moron if they are on twitter&#8221;</p>
<p>Answer: Yep, I said that!  Let me give you context around that.  I do think that if you are well known there is only a downside to it. I can get in a lot of trouble on twitter.  Speed can kill you in these kinds of situations.  I&#8217;m certainly capable of stupid things.</p>
<p>Question: If your aren&#8217;t in social media, how do you connect with fans and get feedback.</p>
<p>Answer: I&#8217;d rather meet people in person. There are too much electronics.  There&#8217;s a time for electronics but think about it.</p>
<p>Question: The reviewers of movies today are the viewers</p>
<p>Answer: Yes that&#8217;s true. Although small movies need a professional reviewer. You can&#8217;t &#8220;steal the weekend&#8221; anymore with good trailers and no reviewers.</p>
<p>Question: Technology has changed film making and distribution.  Adobe has a part in that.  How do you feel when you see someone watching your movies on a tablet or phone?</p>
<p>Answer: What&#8217;s happening in our industry is interesting.  TV for a long time had it&#8217;s limitation.  Now TV, Netflix, etc has put up the quality.  It&#8217;s better than some of the films you see.  It&#8217;s miraculous. It&#8217;s great for our industry in general.  It opens up so many avenues in the entertainment industry.  There&#8217;s 5X more work because of that.</p>
<p>Question: it&#8217;s the democratization of film making.</p>
<p>Answer: Remember that as we get older, we&#8217;ve seen pretty much every story ever made.  The new book is filtered to the same story we&#8217;ve seen so much.  But now you can make a movie from a young person on an iphone. It&#8217;s opening up storytelling again.</p>
<p>Question: New topic. You have a bit of  reputation as a prankster. Tell us.</p>
<p>Answer: There are a couple people who are favorite targets. I do horrible things to Richard ?? Brad Pitt is fun. He&#8217;s mean when he comes back.  When doing Ocean&#8217;s. He&#8217;d gotten a prius. I got a bumper that said &#8220;F&#8221; cops.   There&#8217;s no way he&#8217;s not getting arrested.  I got stationary made up with Brad&#8217;s name.  I then sent letters to actors from Brad.  Hilarity ensued.</p>
<p>Question: Do you think you are getting better with age?</p>
<p>Answer; No, I&#8217;m getting older. Most everything is worse with age.  I suppose the only thing is the idea that you are infinitely more comfortable with things. You are more patient. You have a much better sense of humor about yourself.</p>
<p>Question: At Adobe we believe it&#8217;s important to give back.  Silicon Valley hasn&#8217;t been as good about that. You said once that Hollywood reacts rather than leads when it comes to the important things.</p>
<p>Answer: I believe it but it was out of context.  That said, we look to leaders. I grew up in a time where you were expected to participate in the conversation.  In the US, by and large they are charitable. It&#8217;s hard to do the same outside the US.  It&#8217;s a generous country. I feel that our position has to be what can I do more.   it&#8217;s smaller groups that take responsibility and make change.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lots of excitement during the first full day of Adobe Summit 2016! Was it just me, or did your brain feel like it couldn’t hold any more information at the end of the day?</p>
<p>Among 10,000+ Summit attendees, I was blown away by the announcements and demos during the General Session. Here are the highlights, in case you missed the livestream or didn’t follow along on Twitter:</p>
<p><strong>“This is the Experience Era.”</strong></p>
<p>This eloquently sums up the opening remarks made by Shantanu Narayen, CEO of Adobe. According to Narayen, experiences will be the competitive differentiator for businesses. Experiences start with great content and are powered by data.</p>
<div id="attachment_3190" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="/adobe-blog/files/2016/03/AdobeSummit_BradRencher_Experience_Photo.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-3190"><img class="wp-image-3190 size-medium" src="/adobe-blog/files/2016/03/AdobeSummit_BradRencher_Experience_Photo-300x169.jpg" alt="AdobeSummit_BradRencher_Experience_Photo" width="300" height="169" srcset="/adobe-blog/files/2016/03/AdobeSummit_BradRencher_Experience_Photo-300x169.jpg 300w, /adobe-blog/files/2016/03/AdobeSummit_BradRencher_Experience_Photo.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo by Beth Martin, @betz826</p></div>
<p>Brad Rencher, Executive Vice President of Adobe, echoed this in his talk: “We’re in the third wave of digital transformation for the enterprise, and it’s about the consumer experience.”</p>
<p>He talked about the four success factors for creating great experiences:</p>
<ol>
<li>Know and respect me</li>
<li>Speak in one voice</li>
<li>Make technology transparent</li>
<li>Delight me at every turn</li>
</ol>
<p><span id="more-3189"></span>Rencher also said, “The experience wave is about goosebumps, smiles, and bringing people closer together. It’s the marketer’s job to close the gap between people and the things they want. Then get out of the way.”</p>
<p><strong>McDonald’s Embraces the Experience-Led Business</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_3191" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="/adobe-blog/files/2016/03/Adobe-Summit_McDonalds.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-3191"><img class="wp-image-3191 size-medium" src="/adobe-blog/files/2016/03/Adobe-Summit_McDonalds-300x225.jpg" alt="Adobe Summit_McDonalds" width="300" height="225" srcset="/adobe-blog/files/2016/03/Adobe-Summit_McDonalds-300x225.jpg 300w, /adobe-blog/files/2016/03/Adobe-Summit_McDonalds.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo by Alexander Hopstein, @Digit_Alex</p></div>
<p>Did you ever wonder why McDonald’s started offering breakfast all day? During Rencher’s engaging discussion with Deborah Wahl, CMO of McDonald’s, we learned that the customer was at the heart of this decision.</p>
<p>And when it came to embracing digital in their business model, such as the McDonald’s app or ordering food using a kiosk, Wahl had this to say:</p>
<p>“In digital, there are a lot of shiny toys. We had to focus on timing and balance to get the experience right. We identified the biggest customer need first and provided offers before embracing the ‘shiny objects.’”</p>
<p>McDonald’s mobile app launch mid-year in 2015, and since then, the business has already seen 10 million downloads.</p>
<p>“We’re on a quick journey to be in line with our customer,” Wahl stated.</p>
<p><strong>Order Dunkin Donuts from Your Tesla</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_3193" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="/adobe-blog/files/2016/03/AdobeSummit_DunkinDonuts_Order_Tesla.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-3193"><img class="wp-image-3193 size-medium" src="/adobe-blog/files/2016/03/AdobeSummit_DunkinDonuts_Order_Tesla-300x225.jpg" alt="AdobeSummit_DunkinDonuts_Order_Tesla" width="300" height="225" srcset="/adobe-blog/files/2016/03/AdobeSummit_DunkinDonuts_Order_Tesla-300x225.jpg 300w, /adobe-blog/files/2016/03/AdobeSummit_DunkinDonuts_Order_Tesla.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo by Jay Baer, @jaybaer</p></div>
<p>In the final segment of the General Session, David Nuescheler, VP of Enterprise Technology at Adobe, demonstrated the possibilities of connecting mobile technology in the physical world.</p>
<p>From using your smartphone – with your purchase preferences – to click and confirm your order at a with a Dunkin Donuts kiosk…</p>
<p>To placing your drive-thru order using your in-car connection – even a Tesla!</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to what’s in store for Day 2, and I would love to know what stood out to you among all the information shared during Day 1.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While Adobe Summit has a wide range of focuses, data seems to be a pretty big emphasis, especially with the the data co-0p and key predictive capabilities.  Hence another analytics session.  This particular one focused on best practices and getting past the basics.</p>
<p>He started out with a couple polls, most of the attendees basically love the intellectual stimulation so obviously there were a bunch of data geeks involved.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the end goal?</p>
<p>In ascending order</p>
<ol>
<li>Data exploration</li>
<li>Data visualization</li>
<li>Insights</li>
<li>Action (there is a key chasm between insights and action)</li>
<li>Automated action</li>
<li>Results</li>
</ol>
<p>Some of the questions to ask: what, who, why and then so what.<span id="more-3186"></span></p>
<p><strong>Quote:</strong> What got you here won&#8217;t get you where you want to go</p>
<p><strong>Quote:</strong> Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication (Leanardo DaVinci)  You have to keep your data explanations  as simple as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Key best practice:</strong> Communicate visually. A picture is worth a thousand words.  Use them to better relay key concepts. He showed several examples including some bar charts of pencils.  But the key is to tell a story with the data and visuals.</p>
<p>The same goes for infographics.  You can use various stock photography libraries to make your own infographics.</p>
<p><strong>Best practice:</strong> Tell me what to think.  Don&#8217;t just throw data at it.  Add a little color to highlight things people should see.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good things are green and bad are red btw.</li>
<li>Label the outliers.  you see a peak or a dip, highlight that it was &#8220;Memorial Day&#8221;</li>
<li>Show benchmarks for context.</li>
<li>Avoid the mistake of now showing bad results</li>
<li>Include goals in charts.  Show what you want to achieve vs what you achieved</li>
<li>Show a trended view, not just a point in time.
<ul>
<li>Can also show a trend vs target</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Best Practice:</strong> Align to your corporate objectives.  Then measure yourself in those terms.</p>
<p><strong>Best Practice:</strong> Use composite metrics.  Composite metrics is a combination or index of things with an average.  Nasdaq composite, Dow Jones Index, Quarterback ratings, etc.</p>
<h2>Chris George, VP Product Marketing at Pop Sugar</h2>
<p>Pop Sugar is a media and technology company that caters to 18-35 year old women.  Popsugar.com and shopstyle.com.  Mobile is hitting them in a big way.  Over 70% of visits come from a mobile device.  It&#8217;s really hard to create ads for mobile.   That means they are putting a lot of investment in content marketing (easier on mobile) vs display advertising (banner).</p>
<p>Problem: Marketers are not content creators.</p>
<p>Pop Sugar is focused on using data to identify places to focus on content.   To that end, they&#8217;ve tried very hard to define key content metrics like social sharing.  They created a composite metric: the POPSUGAR engagement score: composits of vists, time spent, social score.  They then plot the composite score over time.   You can then use that data to define what content will have the most relevance to a brand or company.</p>
<p><strong>End result:</strong> Data helps you focus on what content will have the most impact.</p>
<h2>Questions for evaluating your game:</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Are you good at recognizing patterns and breaks in patterns?</li>
<li>Are you better known for the insights you discover or for your ideas or for acting on them?</li>
<li>Are you good at advocating for your ideas?</li>
<li>When someone asks the wrong question, do you answer the question they should have asked?</li>
<li>Do you tend to look for the story in the data of for the data to support your story?</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: this is less about your technical skills and more about just getting the right answers and acting on them.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tamara Gaffney, Principal Analyst Adobe Digital Index and R&#8221;Ray&#8221; Wang, Principal Analyst of Constellation research were ready to make predictions with their big data crystal ball. They took on a variety of topics&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.. all digital marketing related of course.</p>
<p>Note: Big Data refers to the variety of events in the Marketing Cloud including Adobe Analytics.</p>
<p><strong>Looking back:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>in 2015 smartphone visits were up (No duh! right)</li>
<li>Media and entertain ment has a 36.6% uptick</li>
<li>Financial Services up 14.7%</li>
<li>Engagement and converston are still suffering
<ul>
<li>going down on smartphones and desktops</li>
<li>Conversion rates on smartphones are less than half of desktop</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Where are they going</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Tablets have flatlined but no more decline</li>
<li>Smartphones continue to go up. 7% in Jan 2012 to 29% in Jan 2016</li>
<li>Mobile OS visits are stable
<ul>
<li>approx 55% iOS</li>
<li>45% Android slight creep up</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Prediction:</strong> Tablets will come back at some point in time&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.in the form of flexible screens</p>
<p>Screen size will continue to shift.  Don&#8217;t count on this remaining the same</p>
<p><strong>Prediction:</strong> sales and traffic will creep back towards Android.  The Apple trade-in program is bad for Apple pass along use.  Also, Apple is starting to go down market and that has an impact.</p>
<p><span id="more-3175"></span></p>
<p><strong>App World</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There is a steep drop off in app launches</li>
<li>Media, Finance, and Shopping are down
<ul>
<li>Hard to keep these apps in use.</li>
<li>Users have app overload</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Many apps are not just mobile. Many are wifi mode. Media streaming for example</li>
<li>Shopping and Finance have more of a a mobile and smartphone set of use cases</li>
<li>Use cases drive this.  Content consumers spend more time. Transactions take less time</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Prediction</strong>: Biometric authentication will overtake passwords by 2020. This is selfie, heartbeat, fingerprint.  Note: they don&#8217;t take into account privacy law that takes biometrics to NOT be a warrant needy tool.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile Musts for marketers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Mobile is more than a device. It&#8217;s about designing experiences in motion</li>
<li>Make your app easy to authenticate across multiple channel</li>
<li>Think about channel ubiquity or what we call scenes and settings not omni-channel</li>
<li>Study what&#8217;s going on what&#8217;s going on in your Android and iOS base. You will see some interesting shifts including with Android and Samsung Pay</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Search is a crutch for users
<ul>
<li>on mobile devices, there is 76% growth in search. It&#8217;s a &#8220;I hate typing&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>More traffic is going mobile but&#8230;&#8230;. that traffic is not worth as much to you
<ul>
<li>Revenue per visit for mobile was only 50 cents per visit.  So a smart phone is worth 41% less to Google</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Adertising world is throwing more ads on pages&#8230;&#8230; yes we have all seen it</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Prediction:</strong> By Gen Z awareness building marketing will be over.  It&#8217;s a millenial backlash against advertising messing up navigation on mobile. Ray noted that 12 and younger are trained to ignore the ads.</p>
<p>The advertising industry will need to figure out how to make ads count.  Ad bundling may help offset that.</p>
<p><strong>Voice</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Voice rocks our world</li>
<li>Share of digital anticpation
<ul>
<li>Google now 5%
<ul>
<li>Tamara doesn&#8217;t think Google in is the catbird seat.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Windows cortana 5%</li>
<li>Siri 5% Amazon</li>
<li>Echo 2% (most admired btw)</li>
<li>Facebook M 20%
<ul>
<li>Facebook volume has gone up.  People in the 30-50 demographic are going back to Facebook</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This is an open battleground</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advertising Play</strong></p>
<p>Awareness must tie back to brand promise</p>
<p><strong>Future of Entertainment</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>TV everywhere has pickdd up.  17.4%</li>
<li>But kids are at 83% in Teens and Toons genre
<ul>
<li>This is quarter over quarter growth</li>
<li>Kids are watching youtube videos</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Live TV other than sports and election coverage is dead</li>
<li>What are they using to watch tv
<ul>
<li>Apple TV is winning at 10%</li>
<li>But Roku is growing faster.  Roku put out a hi-definition box</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gaming is huge
<ul>
<li>League of legends MOBA is bigger than all other sports</li>
<li>Kids like to watch videos of games being played</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Kids are content consumers and creators
<ul>
<li>They want more content faster</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Prediction:</strong> Android OS TV&#8217;s will cut into Apple TV. It will change the game yet again.  Multi-channel will help drive this.  (Move from phone to home to travel)</p>
<p><strong>Prediction:</strong> Context will be your new mantra.  It&#8217;s about engaging correctly where they are</p>
<p>If you put together these then you&#8217;ve  got good context</p>
<ol>
<li>Identity</li>
<li>Time</li>
<li>Location</li>
<li>Weather</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What to do</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Get a gaming strategy</li>
<li>Gaming is the new advertising opportunity</li>
<li>Expect a convergence of mobile and tv operating systems to shift engagement and consumptiong</li>
<li>Contextually relevant content is the future</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Future of &#8220;Stuff&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Showed a video. With content everywhere, there will be no channel.  You will surface content and apps in windows, stove tops, cars, walls, etc.</p>
<p>Internet of things received with joyful anticipation</p>
<ul>
<li>35% are looking forward to the IoT with smart devices interacting more contextually</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Prediction:</strong> IoT will become mission critical</p>
<p><strong>Prediction:</strong> IoT rollercoaster reaches a peak then takes a steep dive.  Nest with huge bakloas over product outage with baby monitors.  High tech cars facing greater reliability challenges.  See the drone wars.</p>
<p><strong>Prediction</strong>: Bandwidth becomes a public utility.  Bandwidth demand will increase but providers are losing revenue. Prices for bandwidth will go up.  Content delivery and time may change.</p>
<p><strong>Augmented and Virtual Reality</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Oculus Rift was a big thing at South By Southwest
<ul>
<li>Still won&#8217;t come out for a bit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In Utah, they opened a virtual reality gaming place called the void
<ul>
<li>Showed a promo video (below)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Prediction</strong>: VR impacts B2B, healthcare, and gaming first.</p>
<p>How to think about IoT</p>
<ul>
<li>With iot think about scenes and settings and not channels</li>
<li>Value is the contextual insights to make better recommendations</li>
<li>AR and VR have both active and passive approaches to transform experience</li>
<li>Connectivity requires intention driven approach</li>
</ul>
<h3>What else?</h3>
<p>Marketers cannot reassemble fractured identities on your own.  Customers have on average 7.2 devices but on average, a given site only sees 1.2 devices per month in logged in mode.</p>
<p>Prediction: 2016 will be your year of identity.  You want to map experiences and journeys. Identity allows it and users may allow you that information for the convenience. Of course, the battle for identity is everywhere. They all want a piece of your identity or owning that authentication.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jon Bates Group Product Manger Data Science and Machine Learning, gave a session on how to gear up for higher analytics maturity.  Most people have nailed descriptive analytics but are now being pushed to take it to the next level.  Jon wants to provide a vision of what that maturity is.</p>
<p>How to do it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get your core services up so that insights can be actioned</li>
<li>Free up your time by delivering self-service analysis to the business</li>
<li>Get strategic</li>
</ol>
<p>Predictive analytics is like planning for a Marathon. It&#8217;s a series of steps.   You start simple with a 5K and then move on to a 10K, half marathon, and finally a full marathon. Here are the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Descriptive analytics (tactical) &#8211; what happened</li>
<li>Diagnostic analytics &#8211; why</li>
<li>Advanced diagnostic analytics &#8211; why and for whom</li>
<li>Predictive analytics (strategic) &#8211; what&#8217;s next or what could happen</li>
<li>Cognitive analytics- newer with machines making decisions in context</li>
</ol>
