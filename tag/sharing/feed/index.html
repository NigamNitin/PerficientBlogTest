				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gene Phifer spoke about the trends in what Gartner calls the User Experience Platform (UXP).  The big change from last year appears to be a split in the emerging UXP market into Suite vendors and Lean vendors.</p>
<p>Gartner sees many vendors, such as IBM, Microsoft, and Oracle expanding more and more into the Suite side of the market.  There are also emerging vendors in Suite side, including Adobe and Cisco.  On the lean side, we see vendors such as Liferay, Backbase, Drupal and DotNetNuke.</p>
<p>One of the key points I got out of Gene&#8217;s talk is to understand the ethos, or character, of the various vendor products.  Gene offers the following ethos for each vendor.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vendor -&gt; Ethos</strong></li>
<li>Adobe -&gt; Customer</li>
<li>Cisco -&gt; Collaboration</li>
<li>IBM -&gt; Customer; Employee</li>
<li>Oracle -&gt; Business Apps/Process</li>
<li>MS -&gt; Collaboration</li>
<li>SAP -&gt; Business Apps/Process</li>
</ul>
<p>The ethos doesn&#8217;t mean that a vendor can&#8217;t play in another space, but it may be more challenging.</p>
<p>Gene offers the follow strategies to address UXP in the future:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take inventory of portal and portal-like technologies and efforts in your enterprise</li>
<li>Establish governance early, including processes, teams and executive sponsorship</li>
<li>Improve design processes as precursor to UXP adoption</li>
<li>Gather Feedback from stakeholders</li>
<li>Capitalize on widget and gadget integration via RESTful approaches</li>
<li>Plan for an onslaught of mobile requirements</li>
<li>Verify Alignment with Portal Vendor strategies</li>
<li>Devise a framework and establish standards to address ongoing portal and UXP initiatives.</li>
<li>Look at new sourcing strategies: buy  vs build vs hosting vs cloud</li>
</ul>
<p>I asked about how Web Content Management vendors play in the UXP arena.  Gene responded that Personalization is really at the heart of a UXP.  Personalization is something portals do very well.  If you have a content management system that also does a good job of personalization, then that could be the basis of an excellent UXP platform.  See Adobe for an excellent example.  He thinks, and I agree, that we will see Web Content Management vendors becoming players in the UXP market.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Forrester has just released The Forrester Wave for Mobile Collaboration, which does a very good job of highlighting who the leaders are in this market.  The image below shows the Forrester Wave; you can access the full report at <a title="Mobile Collaboration Wave" href="http://www.forrester.com/rb/Research/wave%26trade%3B_mobile_collaboration%2C_q3_2011/q/id/59284/t/2" target="_blank">forrester.com</a>.</p>
<p>What is interesting is that the report includes only those companies that have native applications on <em>multiple</em> mobile operating systems and have some sort of <em>cloud-based</em> solution.  Naturally this criteria is going to leave some companies out, like Apple, Microsoft, and RIM who target apps for one mobile OS.</p>
<p><img class="alignright" title="Mobile Collaboration Wave" src="https://www.cmswire.com/images/forrester_wave_mobilecollab.jpg" alt="Mobile Collaboration Wave" width="436" height="462" /></p>
<div class="mceTemp">
<dl id="" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 446px">
<dd class="wp-caption-dd">Mobile Collaboration Wave</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>The applications included in this Wave are somewhat of a melting pot.  Adobe&#8217;s Connect application is a leader and delivers web-based conferencing.  Comparing that application to Yammer, also a leader but more of a corporate-friendly Facebook, is kind of hard.  Box.com is a file sharing and synchronizing application which is completely different than Connect or Yammer.</p>
<p>Still, the collaboration space is a very broad market consisting of a variety of application types.  It is good to see an evaluation of these different companies not based just on the product they deliver, but on many other factors, such as strategy and market presence.</p>
<p>Forrester rates the leaders in these categories as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Current Offerings: Box, IBM, and Yammer</li>
<li>Strategy: Skype, Box, Cisco, and Yammer</li>
<li>Market Presence: Skype, Cisco, and Google</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have access to Forrester.com, you can read a quick review of this Wave on CMS Wire <a href="http://www.cmswire.com/cms/mobile/new-forrester-wave-highlights-leaders-in-mobile-collaboration-012304.php" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the entire history of the portal, when someone asked, &#8220;When should I use a portal instead of a content management system?&#8221;, the answer was easy.  When you have to login, surface applications, personalize the experience, and otherwise do more than simple content display, then use a portal.  However, that&#8217;s been changing of late.  This isn&#8217;t necessarily a new trend.  The Web Content Management (WCM) vendors have been moving towards this for a while now.  Think of the following example:</p>
<p>Interwoven&#8217;s Livesite let&#8217;s them do more than display static content and the personalization engine can be used much more easily.  It was a long time coming for Iwov but the addition of a run time gave them much more flexibility.</p>
<p>I think that represented a trend that the WCM vendors needed to take in order to survive.  Now let&#8217;s look at a list of functionality you see in <a href="http://www.sitecore.net/en/Products/Sitecore-CMS.aspx">Sitecore,</a> <a href="http://www.day.com/day/en/products.html">Adobe cq5</a>, and <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/lotus/products/webcontentmanagement/">IBM&#8217;s WCM</a> product:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personalization</li>
<li>Marketing campaigns</li>
<li>Deep integration with web analytics include A/B testing with oob marketing suites or separate but related products</li>
<li>Sharepoint integration</li>
<li>Microsoft CRM integration</li>
<li>Out of the box web forms and integration to the web site</li>
<li>Data Provider abstraction layers</li>
<li>Wiki&#8217;s</li>
<li>Blogs</li>
<li>Forums</li>
<li>Tagging</li>
<li>Ratings</li>
<li>Calendaring</li>
<li>Open Social containers for gadget or widget support</li>
<li>Surveys</li>
<li>Advanced workflow engines</li>
<li>WebDav integration</li>
<li>Drag and drop component libraries</li>
<li>Federated search</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s a long list but you will see some similarities to portal.  You will also see some functionality portal products are now starting to deliver.</p>
<h2>My View</h2>
<p>So now the question about when to use a portal or a WCM system has a slightly more nuanced answer.  WCM system provide more functionality than they have in the past.  They make it easier to surface data and even interact with simple widgets and forms.  That said, they are not yet portals.  They don&#8217;t do application interaction yet. They don&#8217;t integrate personalization with both content and applications.  They don&#8217;t do as good a job in hooking to services layers and in creating other integrations to things like user repositories.</p>
<p>That said, you have more reason to do a full review of what you need before choosing to use either a WCM or a Portal.  Even with IBM, I&#8217;m seeing companies looking first to their WCM product and then to their portal product.</p>
<p>So my biggest question is how long it will be before portal and WCM merge? Or if they will merge?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a <a title="Seismic shift in portal market" href="http://blogs.perficient.com/digitaltransformation/2011/03/29/gartner-pcc-gartner-predicts-siesmic-shift-in-portal-market-by-2015/" target="_blank">previous post</a>, I talked about Gartners prediction of a &#8220;seismic shift&#8221; in the portal market.  In one of the last session of the Gartner Portal, Content &amp; Collaboration 2011 Summit, Gene Phifer spoke about the future of portals.  Gene is convinced that the portal market (and mashup market) will be &#8220;subsumed&#8221; by a new User Experience Platform market around 2015.  There are plenty of reasons to see these markets moving to this new UXP market:</p>
<ul>
<li>Organizations are demanding better user experiences in their portals.</li>
<li>They see consumerization driving other products and want it for their portals.</li>
<li>Mobile devices and the need for context-awareness are being demanded by users</li>
</ul>
<p>What about cloud-based portals &#8211; is that in our future?  It certainly is!   Many vendors are starting to offer cloud-based portal systems. But beware!  The very nature of the portal is that it typically connects to a whole bunch of other systems in your organization behind your firewall.  So for a cloud-based portal to be effective, you will need to open up your internal systems to the cloud vendor and have some serious networking pipes. On the other hand, a cloud-based portal would be ideal to integrate your other cloud-based applications.</p>
<p>2015 is still a long way away, so what is happening between now and that future?  Here are the seven things that Gartner sees trending in the portal market over the next few years.</p>
<ul>
<li>Analytics need to be implemented to help gauge the effectiveness of the portal.  There has been a recent flurry of acquisitions in the Web Analytics market by traditional and newer portal vendors</li>
<li>Portal-less Portals &#8211; there are several vendors beginning to offer portal type systems without claiming to be true portals.  Backbase is considered one of those vendors.  <a title="Adobe CQ5" href="http://blogs.perficient.com/digitaltransformation/2011/03/07/adobe-cq5-has-arrived/" target="_blank">Adobe&#8217;s CQ5</a> could also qualify.</li>
<li>Portal ubiquity &#8211; portals will become more ubiquitous as unbind their services</li>
<li>Exploit context across more user attributes (aka enhanced personalization)</li>
<li>Widgets are becoming more important and portlets less-so</li>
<li>Mobile is becoming a key first consideration</li>
<li>The User Experience Platform begins to emerge as a set of cohesive, pre-integrated, highly user interactive services rather than a bunch of products loosely coupled together.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, in terms of vendors, we have basically three major portal vendors today:  IBM, Oracle, and Microsoft.  Close behind are our open source friends Liferay and JBoss. As the market begins to move toward this UXP concept, we are going to see lots of other vendors emerge with UXP offerings.  Firms from the content management space are beginning to move toward UXP, as are firms in the Social Software, Mashups, Portal-less Portals and other Markets.</p>
<p>Here are some vendors to keep your eye on over the next few years:</p>
<p>IBM, Oracle, Microsoft, Liferay, Redhat JBoss, Backbase, Adobe, Cisco, Google, Apple, United Planet, JackBe, NetVibes, Pageflakes, Fatwire, Extron, Automony, Drupal, DotNetNuke, Plone, Jive, Atlassian, Telligent, SocialText.</p>
