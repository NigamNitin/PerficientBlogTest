				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Using Visitor ID to connect visitor profiles across Adobe Analytics, Target, and Audience Manager has been on Adobe’s to do list for a long time and many marketers as well. Far too long, integration between the Adobe products included many gaps and data integration issues such cookie deletion and dependency on data collection servers to setting their version of a third party cookie, called “s_vi”. As a temporarily solution, Adobe set a default backup cookie, “s_fid”, in case the cookie was deleted since these cookies were being set by servers outside the parent domain on a browser. The other option and more cumbersome solution for implementing the first party visitor ID cookie was to use a CNAME record on our client&#8217;s DNS in order to avoid setting a 3rd party cookie altogether. Obviously, there was a need and room to grow from Adobe’s side.<br />
The Marketing Cloud Visitor ID service, AMCV ID, is supported by the following libraries and SDKs: Adobe Dynamic Tag Mnagement, Adobe Analytyics, Adobe Audience Manager, Adobe Target and Adobe Mobile Services.</p>
<p><em><a href="/adobe-blog/files/2016/05/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud-Visitor-ID-framework.png"><img class=" wp-image-3938 aligncenter" src="/adobe-blog/files/2016/05/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud-Visitor-ID-framework-300x144.png" alt="Adobe Marketing Cloud Visitor ID framework" width="460" height="221" srcset="/adobe-blog/files/2016/05/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud-Visitor-ID-framework-300x144.png 300w, /adobe-blog/files/2016/05/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud-Visitor-ID-framework.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px" /></a></em></p>

<strong>Migrating from Adobe Analytics Legacy Visitor ID</strong><br />
This migration will either store the legacy cookie (s_vi) to the AMCV cookie or create a new AMCV cookie, which will be used as its replacement all together.</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisites &#8211; Adobe Requirements<br />
</strong><br />
1. Contact Client Care to obtain the Marketing Cloud Organization ID ie. (MCOrg ID)<br />
2. Ensure your scode is on AppMeasurement version 1.3 or later, scode H.27 or later.<br />
3. Make sure your Adobe Adobe server calls are going to Regional Data Collection, meaning your image requests are being sent to RDC tracking server ( ie. .sc.omtrdc.net) instead of a Non-RDC tracking server, (ie. .2o7.net).<br />
4. Next, deploy your new VisitorAPI Javascript library. Log into your Admin Console and get the VisitorAPI.js file from the Code Manager. This can be in your scode file or in DTM in the tool’s setting, but it must be placed at the beginning of the file. Important Note: The placement of this code needs to fire first in the order sequence in order to be leveraged by the other Adobe JS libraries.<br />
5. Configure your Visitor ID service.<br />
6. Set Visitor ID in a Custom Variable (sprop or eVar) to test quality assurance. (Below is the Custom JS to capture the AMCV in a DTM Data Element that is ready to be mapped to a custom variable.) You can also set the AMCV in a cookie using a native DTM function to either map or verify in the Developers Console. (_satellite.setCookie(&#8216;cookie name&#8217;,&#8217;cookie value&#8217;,days to expire)<br />
7. As precaution, please be sure to check Adobe Analytics server call as there should be an additional parameter called “mid”, the Marketing Cloud Visitor ID.</p>
<p><a href="/adobe-blog/files/2016/05/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud-ID-Dynamic-Tag-Managment-Data-Element.png"><img class="wp-image-3940 aligncenter" src="/adobe-blog/files/2016/05/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud-ID-Dynamic-Tag-Managment-Data-Element-300x153.png" alt="Adobe Marketing Cloud ID - Dynamic Tag Managment Data Element" width="676" height="345" srcset="/adobe-blog/files/2016/05/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud-ID-Dynamic-Tag-Managment-Data-Element-300x153.png 300w, /adobe-blog/files/2016/05/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud-ID-Dynamic-Tag-Managment-Data-Element-768x393.png 768w, /adobe-blog/files/2016/05/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud-ID-Dynamic-Tag-Managment-Data-Element-600x307.png 600w, /adobe-blog/files/2016/05/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud-ID-Dynamic-Tag-Managment-Data-Element.png 1107w" sizes="(max-width: 676px) 100vw, 676px" /></a></p>
<p>Now that you have the foundation for your Adobe Target, Adobe Analytics, Adobe Media Optimizer and Adobe Audience Manager tools, you can feel confident about your data being unified and now you are finally ready to start building your campaigns, profiles, activities, and reports.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, Adobe kicked off its annual Adobe Summit conference for digital marketing. This is an important year for Adobe as many of its competitors are trying to jump ahead of Adobe in this space. Adobe has excellent products and excellent vision, but still recognizes the need to reinvent their products for the evolving digital marketing landscape.</p>
<p>Brad Rencher, Adobe&#8217;s SVP for Marketing Cloud, made the argument to more than 7,000 people attending this year&#8217;s conference that customer experience is now <em>the</em> key part of your brand.</p>
<div id="attachment_783" style="width: 306px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="/adobe-blog/files/2015/03/brad.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-783" src="/adobe-blog/files/2015/03/brad-296x300.png" alt="Brad Rencher" width="296" height="300" srcset="/adobe-blog/files/2015/03/brad-296x300.png 296w, /adobe-blog/files/2015/03/brad-300x305.png 300w, /adobe-blog/files/2015/03/brad.png 463w" sizes="(max-width: 296px) 100vw, 296px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Brad Rencher</p></div>
<p>This makes Digital Marketing the epicenter of your digital transformation efforts. Of course, Adobe is at the epicenter for many brands and wants to be the epicenter of more customers.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Shantanu Narayen, Adobe&#8217;s CEO, talked about Changing the World Through Digital Experiences. Marketing is on a reinvention journey but fundamentals of marketing are not changing. The art of marketing creative is still a key pat of the equation. Science in the form of data analysis, behavior analytics, etc have contributed to elevating marketing to a new level. Real-time has impacted the enterprise is completely new and different ways.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This has led to the era of &#8220;Your Product is Marketing&#8221;, according to Shantanu.  So now, you have to ask broader questions about your products and look at new ways to enhance the customer experience. This has impacted Adobe too and they are looking at how to enhance their own products into a unified experience through the Marketing Cloud. </span></p>
<p class="p1">Brad came back onstage to talk about consumer expectations around being consistency and continuous. The customer experience is the brand and marketing has to move beyond just marketing. Marketing has to take on the many customer experiences your brand has and make them consistent and continuous.</p>
<p class="p1"><span id="more-771"></span>Coca Cola talked about their mission is to create happiness experiences for their customers. Their marketing efforts are not just about the logo, the colors, or even the product. By creating these happiness experiences they keep consumers connected to the brand.  As an example, they created a &#8220;hug machine&#8221; for finals week at a college campus.  When a student hugged the machine, they received a Coke in return. It was a fun and creative way to help students relieve stress and connect to the Coca Cola brand.</p>
<p class="p1">One way Adobe is developing a unified experience is through the Marketing Cloud. Adobe follows these these principles when looking at the Marketing Cloud:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Comprehensive</li>
<li class="p1">Integrated across channels both online and offline</li>
<li class="p1">Actionable for both data and content</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Brad fired off a bunch of announcements that will detailed out throughout the week at Adobe Summit. Briefly, here are some of those announcements that I could capture as Brad talked:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Adobe Analytics announced Customer Intelligence (integrate customer data) and Predictive Analytics.</li>
<li class="p1">Experience Manager is the backbone of content in the Marketing Cloud.  AEM Assets provides asset management in a Saas environment. Adobe is also delivering a pre-built AEM to get smaller companies and departments running quickly.</li>
<li class="p1">Campaign has been integrated across all the Marketing Cloud solutions.  They also greatly enhanced the email marketing components of Campaign</li>
<li class="p1">Target will deliver personalization beyond just web and mobile and into IoT.</li>
<li class="p1">Social is mobile enabled so you can publish on the go.</li>
<li class="p1">Media Optimizer has been rebuilt to be more programmatic.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Brad announced two new solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Adobe Prime Time &#8211; this puts the TV experience on any screen.  Marketers can track usage.  There is also continuous delivery from mobile to desktop to TV.</li>
<li class="p1">Adobe Audience Manager connects audiences to programmatic features of the cloud and integrates across the Adobe Core Services.</li>
</ul>
