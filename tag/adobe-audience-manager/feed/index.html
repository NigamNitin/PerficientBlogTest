				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Using Visitor ID to connect visitor profiles across Adobe Analytics, Target, and Audience Manager has been on Adobe’s to do list for a long time and many marketers as well. Far too long, integration between the Adobe products included many gaps and data integration issues such cookie deletion and dependency on data collection servers to setting their version of a third party cookie, called “s_vi”. As a temporarily solution, Adobe set a default backup cookie, “s_fid”, in case the cookie was deleted since these cookies were being set by servers outside the parent domain on a browser. The other option and more cumbersome solution for implementing the first party visitor ID cookie was to use a CNAME record on our client&#8217;s DNS in order to avoid setting a 3rd party cookie altogether. Obviously, there was a need and room to grow from Adobe’s side.<br />
The Marketing Cloud Visitor ID service, AMCV ID, is supported by the following libraries and SDKs: Adobe Dynamic Tag Mnagement, Adobe Analytyics, Adobe Audience Manager, Adobe Target and Adobe Mobile Services.</p>
<p><em><a href="/adobe-blog/files/2016/05/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud-Visitor-ID-framework.png"><img class=" wp-image-3938 aligncenter" src="/adobe-blog/files/2016/05/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud-Visitor-ID-framework-300x144.png" alt="Adobe Marketing Cloud Visitor ID framework" width="460" height="221" srcset="/adobe-blog/files/2016/05/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud-Visitor-ID-framework-300x144.png 300w, /adobe-blog/files/2016/05/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud-Visitor-ID-framework.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px" /></a></em></p>

<strong>Migrating from Adobe Analytics Legacy Visitor ID</strong><br />
This migration will either store the legacy cookie (s_vi) to the AMCV cookie or create a new AMCV cookie, which will be used as its replacement all together.</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisites &#8211; Adobe Requirements<br />
</strong><br />
1. Contact Client Care to obtain the Marketing Cloud Organization ID ie. (MCOrg ID)<br />
2. Ensure your scode is on AppMeasurement version 1.3 or later, scode H.27 or later.<br />
3. Make sure your Adobe Adobe server calls are going to Regional Data Collection, meaning your image requests are being sent to RDC tracking server ( ie. .sc.omtrdc.net) instead of a Non-RDC tracking server, (ie. .2o7.net).<br />
4. Next, deploy your new VisitorAPI Javascript library. Log into your Admin Console and get the VisitorAPI.js file from the Code Manager. This can be in your scode file or in DTM in the tool’s setting, but it must be placed at the beginning of the file. Important Note: The placement of this code needs to fire first in the order sequence in order to be leveraged by the other Adobe JS libraries.<br />
5. Configure your Visitor ID service.<br />
6. Set Visitor ID in a Custom Variable (sprop or eVar) to test quality assurance. (Below is the Custom JS to capture the AMCV in a DTM Data Element that is ready to be mapped to a custom variable.) You can also set the AMCV in a cookie using a native DTM function to either map or verify in the Developers Console. (_satellite.setCookie(&#8216;cookie name&#8217;,&#8217;cookie value&#8217;,days to expire)<br />
7. As precaution, please be sure to check Adobe Analytics server call as there should be an additional parameter called “mid”, the Marketing Cloud Visitor ID.</p>
<p><a href="/adobe-blog/files/2016/05/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud-ID-Dynamic-Tag-Managment-Data-Element.png"><img class="wp-image-3940 aligncenter" src="/adobe-blog/files/2016/05/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud-ID-Dynamic-Tag-Managment-Data-Element-300x153.png" alt="Adobe Marketing Cloud ID - Dynamic Tag Managment Data Element" width="676" height="345" srcset="/adobe-blog/files/2016/05/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud-ID-Dynamic-Tag-Managment-Data-Element-300x153.png 300w, /adobe-blog/files/2016/05/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud-ID-Dynamic-Tag-Managment-Data-Element-768x393.png 768w, /adobe-blog/files/2016/05/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud-ID-Dynamic-Tag-Managment-Data-Element-600x307.png 600w, /adobe-blog/files/2016/05/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud-ID-Dynamic-Tag-Managment-Data-Element.png 1107w" sizes="(max-width: 676px) 100vw, 676px" /></a></p>
<p>Now that you have the foundation for your Adobe Target, Adobe Analytics, Adobe Media Optimizer and Adobe Audience Manager tools, you can feel confident about your data being unified and now you are finally ready to start building your campaigns, profiles, activities, and reports.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sean Dickson (Adobe) and Kathleen (Intuit) presented at Adobe Summit 2015 on identity management. This becomes increasingly important with the proliferation of both channels/devices and services (think all the services in the Adobe Marketing Cloud)</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="/adobe-blog/files/2015/02/working_on_computer_shutterstock_wordpress.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-612" src="/adobe-blog/files/2015/02/working_on_computer_shutterstock_wordpress-300x200.jpg" alt="working_on_computer_shutterstock_wordpress" width="300" height="200" srcset="/adobe-blog/files/2015/02/working_on_computer_shutterstock_wordpress-300x200.jpg 300w, /adobe-blog/files/2015/02/working_on_computer_shutterstock_wordpress-600x400.jpg 600w, /adobe-blog/files/2015/02/working_on_computer_shutterstock_wordpress.jpg 651w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Mapping the customer journey and marketing touchpoints in the cross-device ecosystem is critical to understanding the path to conversion. The data management platform (DMP) has evolved into an identity management platform with marketers now having the ability to identify customers across various personal devices. In this session, we’ll talk with Adobe AudienceManager customers and experts as we tackle the shift from data management to identity management.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><strong>Question</strong>: Why do we care about data?<br />
<span id="more-823"></span><br />
Answer: because of what it tells us about people.</p>
<p class="p1">Key Takeaways</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Bulid a business case for identity</li>
<li class="p1">Educate and align people on what it is</li>
<li class="p1">Developer a customer centric view to increase ROI through the identity</li>
</ol>
<p>Digital Identity is complex</p>
<ul>
<li>anonymous
<ul>
<li>product search</li>
<li>Clicks on product</li>
<li>Views on ads</li>
<li>3rd party data</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Known User
<ul>
<li>Signed in</li>
<li>Purchase history</li>
<li>Precise demo</li>
<li>Offline CRM</li>
<li>Registration info</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Think of four steps</p>
<ol>
<li>Listen &#8211; what do you know about the user from social, crm, and erd parties</li>
<li>Decide &#8211; How do ai want to combine this info for a given channel</li>
<li>Assemble &#8211; a dynamic profile merged from appropriate sources</li>
<li>Deliver &#8211; the right experience to the right targeting channel at the right time</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: What can you do with profiles across devices?</p>
<p>Audience Manager and profile management capabilities allow you to specify conditions under which to merge profiles across devices.  Think of everything you track while the user is anonymous and on the web. Now think about what you gain.  Once logged in, you can log that device and actions into the profile.  This is called deterministic identity management (link with login id)</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> What can you do within a single device?</p>
<p>Audience Manager provides device and profile management capabilities that allow you to specify the conditions under which to merge multiple profiles within  device</p>
<p>Think about Jennifer picking up the iPad, logging in, doing a variety of things then Ben logs in.  Under this scenario, you might want to use only the current authenticated profile.  But you do have a choice to merge current user, last known user, or all users on a device.</p>
<p>Think of this as a household scenario.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> What is involved in a rollout?</p>
<p>1. Deploy a JavaScript library (Declared ID DIL)  This captures login ID at moment of authentication</p>
<p>2. Deploy Mobile SKD: This is the same thing but not as JavaScript. Still grabs authenticated id to create known profile.</p>
<p>3. Probabilistic Platform Integration: Connect profiles across ad inventory based on certain key strings.  You can extend your identity management beyond the known.</p>
<p><strong>Few Items to Consider</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Known profile does not have to mean PII (personally identifiable information)</li>
<li>Merging anonymous and known profile data depends on context.
<ul>
<li>Does your privacy policy allow for this for examples</li>
<li>What type of data are you merging?</li>
<li>What state is the user in when targeting the user (logged in, not logged in now?)  May want to be careful about what you say to them depending on that state.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Attribution tracking of anonymous activities</li>
</ul>
<h2>Identity Management at Intuit</h2>
<p>Kathleen spoke about Intuit Turbo Tax journey with Adobe Audience Manager (AAM).</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Why identity management at AAM?</p>
<p>Answer: the world is changing from mass consumption as one screen to consumption across many devices.</p>
<p>TurboTax started mobile with a heavy investment in product.  Started with SnapTax app four years ago.  Last year, they realized that wasn&#8217;t good enough and reinvented the mobile experience to a native TurboTax experience across channels.</p>
<h3>Aligning the Organization, Definition, and Team</h3>
<p>Have to think in terms of the different considerations to leverage identity. Marketing, Engineering, Analytics, Privacy.</p>
<h3>Leveraging Cross-Device Behavior (informed customer centric views)</h3>
<p>Intuit tries to think about what value they can bring to those who already bought the service and filed for a refund.  In that case it might be about getting them to use Mint, another product in the Intuit family.</p>
<p>Cross-device targeting can get expensive if you deliver the same ad again to a user who already has your service or who just got it on another device.  May want to think about how to drop them out.</p>
