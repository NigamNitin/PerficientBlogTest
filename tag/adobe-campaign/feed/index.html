				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.adobe.com/marketing-cloud/campaign-management.html" target="_blank">Adobe Campaign</a> includes a <a href="https://docs.campaign.adobe.com/doc/AC6.1/en/INS_Appendices_Command_lines.html" target="_blank">command line interface</a> by which administrators and developers can interact with the system via a command line interface, instead of the graphical user interface. Included in this command line interface is a tool for importing and exporting packages directly through the command line. This allows teams and users to more easily share and deploy configurations and content between Adobe Campaign instances.</p>
<p>To manage packages using the Adobe Campaign command line interface, perform the following:<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Step 1: Create Package</h3>
<p>To manage packages in Adobe Campaign through the command line interface, first you will need to create the package from within Adobe Campaign.</p>
<p><img src="/digitaltech/files/2015/11/adobe-campaign-package.png" alt="Creating a Package in Adobe Campaign" /></p>
<p>Once you have created the package and defined its contents, copy the package name. We&#8217;ll use this in the next step.<br />
<span id="more-2609"></span><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Step 2: Export Package</h3>
<p>Next, login to the Adobe Campaign Server and execute one of the following command:</p>
<pre><code>nlserver package -instance:[instance_name] -export:[target_file] -spec:[package_name] -verbose</code></pre>
<p>The parameters are:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>instance_name</em>: the name of the instance, as defined in the config-[instance_name].xml in Adobe Campaign&#8217;s conf directory</li>
<li><em>target_file: </em>the file to write the package contents to, does not have to exist</li>
<li><em>package_name:</em> the name of the package you defined in step 1</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ve also added the verbose flag to get more verbose output in the case of errors or warnings.</p>
<p>An example of this command and its output is below:</p>
<pre><code>C:AdobeAdobe Campaign Server v6bin&gt;nlserver package -instance:dev -export:C:UsersbootcampDesktoppackage.xml -spec:drk:devPackage -verbose<br />23:39:56 &gt; Application server for Adobe Campaign Version 6.1.1 (build 8667) of 08/04/2015<br />23:39:56 &gt; Loading configuration for instance 'dev'<br />23:39:56 &gt; Starting 1 connection(s) on pool 'default dev' (PostgreSQL, server='localhost', login='dev:dev')<br />23:39:56 &gt; Library 'libpq.dll' loaded from 'C:AdobeAdobe Campaign Server v6binlibpq.dll'<br />23:39:56 &gt; Exporting package 'drk:devPackage'...
C:AdobeAdobe Campaign Server v6bin&gt;</code></pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Step 3: Import Package</h3>
<p>Once the package is exported it can be shared modified or distributed as needed. To re-import the package into the same or a different instance, execute the command:</p>
<pre><code>nlserver package -instance:[instance_name] -import:[target_file] -verbose</code></pre>
<p>The parameters are:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>instance_name</em>: same as export, this is the name of the instance, as defined in the config-[instance_name].xml in Adobe Campaign&#8217;s conf directory</li>
<li><em>target_file: </em>the file to write read the package content from, must exist and be a valid package file</li>
</ul>
<p>An example of this command and its output is below:</p>
<pre><code>C:AdobeAdobe Campaign Server v6conf&gt;nlserver package -instance:dev -import:C:Usersbootcampdesktoppackage.xml -verbose<br />00:04:49 &gt; Application server for Adobe Campaign Version 6.1.1 (build 8667) of 08/04/2015<br />00:04:49 &gt; Loading configuration for instance 'dev'<br />00:04:49 &gt; Starting 1 connection(s) on pool 'default dev' (PostgreSQL, server='localhost', login='dev:dev')<br />00:04:49 &gt; Library 'libpq.dll' loaded from 'C:AdobeAdobe Campaign Server v6binlibpq.dll'<br />00:04:49 &gt; Importing package 'C:Usersbootcampdesktoppackage.xml'...<br />00:04:50 &gt; Enumerating the file entities...<br />00:04:50 &gt; Writing entities in the database...<br />00:04:50 &gt; Saving data related to packages...<br />00:04:50 &gt; Package 'Dan Dev Package': Saving entities of type 'nms:recipient'...<br />00:04:50 &gt; Package 'Dan Dev Package': Saving entities of type 'xtk:specFile'...<br />00:04:50 &gt; Installation of packages successful.</code></pre>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Hopefully this helps anyone wanting to know more about using Adobe Campaign&#8217;s powerful command line interface and to improve their process by more easily sharing and distributing content and configurations for Adobe Campaign.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At Adobe Summit, Ben Tepfer, Mickael Bentz and Urosh Pajic talked about how Adobe has integrated Experience Manager with Adobe Campaign. Too often a company&#8217;s campaign system is totally separate from the content management system. So, you end up with duplicate content, inconsistent experiences, inconsistent tracking of results, and an inefficient process.</p>
<p>Adobe wanted to streamline content creation within the campaign process, eliminate technology silos and complex data flows and accelerate campaign time to market. In the Marketing Cloud, Campaign orchestrates the campaign workflow, manages targeted segments and provides measurement and reporting. Experience Manager provides the tools to create and manage content that would be delivered through a campaign.</p>
<p>Here are the benefits from integrating these products:<span id="more-925"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Integrated cross-channel content authoring. Messages are created in AEM and then delivered by Campaign.  This gives you access to existing assets, and great tools to compose a personalized email message through pre-built templates. One company cited a 50% reduction in the time to publish content.</li>
<li>Extend collaboration with AEM Assets that come from the Creative Cloud can be reused easily in each campaign without copying files from one system to the other.  This makes both creative and marketing teams more agile, effective and efficient. Also workflows in AEM can be used to make sure content is approved before it gets pushed out to customers.</li>
<li>User data can be shared between both systems.  This unified data can be used to personalize email as well as the web site.  Segments created in AEM can be used within Campaign. You can also create forms in AEM that can be used in the email.  Further, user data can be pre-populated to make it easier for the user to submit the form.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="line-height: 28px">All of these capabilities are available across channels. </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 28px">Where to start with this integration?  First understand your organization and who has what content and assets.  Next centralize your content and assets into Creative Cloud and AEM.  Finally reimagine your workflows and how you can improve the process.  </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 28px"> </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A key question for a technology vendor is &#8220;Do you use your own technology for what you are selling to the rest of us?&#8221; It&#8217;s often frustrating to me to visit a web content manager&#8217;s web site and find that they don&#8217;t use their own product to manage the site.</p>
<p>At the Adobe Summit, I&#8217;m attending a session called <em>Adobe on Adobe:Implementing a next generation cross-channel marketing solution</em> where we get to hear how Adobe replaced two incumbent enterprise marketing solutions with Adobe Campaign.</p>
<p><img class=" aligncenter" src="https://www.cmswire.com/images/Adobe%20Flow.jpg" alt="" width="478" height="269" /></p>
<p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p>
<p>Adobe has acquired several companies who each had their own marketing tools. After the acquisitions, Adobe struggled to be consistent in their marketing efforts across all these other legacy systems. They had trouble sharing marketing data.  Platforms had trouble scaling and performance issues. The need for reinvention became apparent as Adobe grew faster.</p>
<p><strong>The Plan</strong><span id="more-876"></span></p>
<p>After Adobe acquired Neolane which became Adobe Campaign, they decided to move all the cross-channel marketing to Campaign. They were asked to move all of there programs in a few months which was really impossible.  So they decided to create a thoughtful plan that included a current state assessment, requirements gathering, and user research to figure out exactly how to move over to Campaign.</p>
<p>They focused on change management because of the move from a variety of old systems to this new platform.</p>
<p>In addition to using the Adobe system, they also managed the project following their best practices for deploying the solution to Adobe customers. They developed a roadmap along with requirements that included must haves and nice to haves.</p>
<p><strong>The Results (so far)</strong></p>
<p>Within 6 months they started migrating lead management and within 9 months they moved all of their high-volume emails over to Adobe Campaign.</p>
<p>Now Adobe has 130M recipients in their database.  They deployed 1.1B personalized emails in 2014. They had 130+ lead nurturing programs in 2014.</p>
<p>In lead scoring across several dimensions, they had 11x performance increase for the automated platform and 3x performance increase in the end-to-end, CRM to automated platform.  This has lead to dramatic increase on contact rate for those leads.</p>
<p><strong>Lessons Learned</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The migration was hard because Adobe had built up a lot of assets, knowledge and practices across all the acquisitions over the years.</li>
<li>Build an inventory of what content / programs will move and which will be left behind.  This helps identify how long the migration will actually take.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t design for perfection, but get going fast and make updates as you go along.</li>
<li>The most challenging part of the implementation was not the technology side, but change management, business process change, and skills changes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tips and Tricks</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>When doing an implementation like this, make sure you have a good time with authority to make decisions.</li>
<li>Campaign is very flexible, so you should spend time planning out what you want to do before diving into it.</li>
<li>From a technical perspective, Campaign is very transactional.  So you have to make sure the database is tuned, decide what data is going to reside in the database versus what can be referenced.</li>
<li>Need a well defined process for on-boarding users.  Adobe created scenario-based user guides rather than feature-based.  Templates are a must to get the users up and running quickly.  Checklists are very handy to remind occasional users what to do when they use the system.</li>
<li>For training, they did a hub and spoke model to train a hub person in each region.  They also held specific office hours for each region so they could call when they were first starting out.</li>
<li>They used to use Batch and Blast for campaigns. Now they are starting to use workflows to plan out the experience better.</li>
</ol>
<p>Adobe hasn&#8217;t finished the migration just yet.  They will continue to migrate everyone over to Campaign and will be optimizing their programs this year.  They are also integrating with their other Marketing Cloud tools.</p>

He started with a poll of the audience. Most people use a variety of channels with eMail being the most popular.</p>
<p>Kelly Reilly (@KerryReilly1), Director Product Marketing talked about the details of Campaign. Campaign is intended to redefine how brands engage with consumers. Kelly introduced the following core:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integrated Customer Profile brings together information you about the customers.</li>
<li>Targeted Segmentation using the data from the customer profiles.</li>
<li>Visual Campaign Orchestration or workflow for the campaign.  Visual is the key here as the tool is very visual to build the workflow making it easier for marketing professionals.</li>
<li>Cross Channel Execution to deliver the campaign</li>
<li>Real time interaction management to target a customer as soon as they visit the web site or call the contact center.</li>
<li>Operational Reporting is a must have to identify which programs are working and why.</li>
</ul>
<p>Best practices for campaign management:<span id="more-798"></span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: left">LA Kings wanted to increase customer knowledge and deliver personalized fan experiences.  They saw a 10% uplift in online renewals.  They identified positive ROI and increased revenue through these personalized experiences. Below is a video that talks about how the Kings did this.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Sephora used campaigns for both instore and online experiences.  They saw a 70% productivity jump in creating campaigns</li>
<li>Elsevier wanted to enhance customer communications, increase engagement, and implement best practices. They saw 30% increase in open rates and cost savings across their marketing efforts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Campaign is now integrated across the Marketing Cloud to address these three challenges:<!--more--></p>
<ul>
<li>Big Data to integrate customer data from a variety of sources</li>
<li>Delivery of Campaigns offline and online, different devices, etc.</li>
<li>Content personalization and streamlining content across channels</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the integrations</p>
<ul>
<li>Campaign and Analytics &#8211; Real Time analytics connected to targeted segments. Analytics can tell you about abandoned carts and those customers can then be targeted via Campaign.  If you can target those customers within an hour, you can increase conversions.</li>
<li>Campaign and Core Services &#8211; Can share audiences to the marketing cloud and push marketing cloud audiences back to Campaign.  The shared data can be used to enhance personalization.</li>
<li>Campaign and Target &#8211; Target is the testing and optimization tool.  Target has been extended to include eMail content.  Campaign can target content in the email using personalized and contextual content.</li>
<li>Campaign and Experience Manager &#8211; connects the Marketing Cloud with the Creative Cloud. Assets loaded into the cloud are reflected in the content used by Campaign.  This creates a consistent brand experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ben Tepfer (@bentepfer), Product Marketing Manager demo&#8217;d Campaign.  He showed how a campaign workflow can integrate content from Adobe Experience Manager to create highly personalized content when a user opens a web site from a push notification generated by Campaign.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Matthew Rawding, a Consulting Manager with Adobe. talked about how to use Adobe Campaign to create an integrated customer profile.  So what is an integrated customer profile?<img class="alignright" alt="" src="https://blogs.adobe.com/conversations/files/2013/09/Adobe-Campaign.jpeg" width="461" height="454" /></p>
<p>An integrated customer profile is a main pillar of Adobe Campaign.  Also included in Campaign are targeted segmentation, visual campaign orchestration, cross-channel execution, real time interaction management, and operational reporting.</p>
<p>The goal is to build the most comprehensive view of a customer possible based on the following sets of data.</p>
<ul>
<li>Contact Information</li>
<li>Sociodemographic data</li>
<li>Computed Data &#8211; compute additional attributes based on other data</li>
<li>Explicit customer data &#8211; data provided by the customer as in a customer preference</li>
<li>Implicit customer data &#8211; data we gather</li>
<li>Scoring attributes</li>
</ul>
<p>A key message here is: The more you can gather and manage data, the fewer guesses you have to make as a marketer.</p>
<p>Adobe Campaign provides a way to collect and manage all this data about customers.  This allows you to market directly to customers by knowing this much about each customer.</p>
<p>You want to have conversations with customers, not just communications.  This means listening to what the customers are saying through explicit and implicit data.  In Campaign, you can use this data to target specific customers and target the specific communications methods they prefer. Workflows all you to split a campaign across devices, so if one person prefers email they get an email, while another customer that prefers phone, gets a phone call.</p>
<p>Data aggregation is important. You can load all data into one DB. Or you can map datasources based on common keys.  Or you can use a hybrid model of collecting data in one place and mapping that data to sources that can&#8217;t be collected.</p>
<p>Matthew provided a 9-point checklist for building an integrated customer profile.  The first 5 steps are all about planning.</p>
<ol>
<li>Define Business Need</li>
<li>Identify data sources</li>
<li>Located Other Sources</li>
<li>Invest in Data Governance</li>
<li>Plan out your Data Ecosystem</li>
<li>Implementation</li>
<li>Automation</li>
<li>Measurement</li>
<li>Maintenance</li>
</ol>
<p>The process above is iterative. You periodically have to go through iterations of some or all of the steps.</p>
<p>In Adobe Campaign, they have a very recipient oriented data model. This data includes data from delivery logs, tracking logs, proposition logs, survey logs and sales transactions.  There is often a need to include loyalty data, but you can map this data into the Campaign.</p>
<p>Campaign also includes a data loading workflow which automates the importation of data.<img class="alignright" alt="" src="https://www.cmswire.com/assets_c/2013/06/screenshot-neolanecampaigns-2013-thumb-600x345-15696.png" width="424" height="244" />  This sounds like a typical ETL process.</p>
<p>De-duplication is an important and complicated part of the process.  De-duplication rules need to be created and monitored. Campaigns uses a score-based matching system to do de-duping. This allows you to assign a base rule followed by the scoring rules.  Scoring rule allows you to add weights to specific conditions.  Totaled together, the base match and score rule results indicated a matched record.  Campaign calls this an <em>Enrichment </em>activity in the workflow.</p>
<p>After you have the de-duplication rules, you can also set <em>Merge</em> rules to the system which data fields to keep from which duplicate record.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Patrick Tripp and Stephane Bline presented on Adobe Campaign (formerly Neolane)</p>
<p>They started off with a video on key information you know about customers like:</p>
<ul>
<li>bought 5 concert tickets</li>
<li>is a season ticket holder</li>
<li>opened but did not click season renewal</li>
<li>How he bought his tickets
<ul>
<li>2 at the door</li>
<li>3 online</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Cross-Channel marketing is about understanding the preference of the consumer and determining how you can engage with them.</p>
<p>Adobe Campaign brings the data together to deliver a personalized experience via a variety of channel.  You treat different segmented consumers differently based on their known interests and preferred channels.</p>
<p><strong>Quote:</strong> There is no such thing as a one size fits all approach to customer engagement anymore.</p>
<h2>The Solution</h2>
<p>It delivers six unique capabilities</p>
<ol>
<li>Integrated Customer Profile</li>
<li>Targeted Segmentation</li>
<li>Visual Campaign Orchestration</li>
<li>Cross-channel execution</li>
<li>Real-time interaction management</li>
<li>Operational reporting</li>
</ol>
<h3>Integrated Customer profile</h3>
<p>This is the life blood of Adobe Campaign.  It&#8217;s central to everything they do with Adobe Campaign. Match.com knows more about their members than anyone else.   They store the profile of every consumer. They use it to deliver messages in real time.  They send millions of messages a day.</p>
<h3>Target Segmentation</h3>
<p>Use the profile  to drive one-to-one personalization.  It enhances the effectiveness of marketing.</p>
<h3>Visual Campaign Orchestration</h3>
<p>Use the segmentation, data, and workflow to create the interaction with the customer.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7150" alt="workflow" src="https://blogs.perficient.com/portals/files/2014/03/workflow.jpg" width="795" height="150" srcset="/adobe-blog/files/2014/03/workflow.jpg 795w, /adobe-blog/files/2014/03/workflow-300x57.jpg 300w, /adobe-blog/files/2014/03/workflow-768x145.jpg 768w, /adobe-blog/files/2014/03/workflow-600x113.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 795px) 100vw, 795px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2></h2>
<h2></h2>
<h2></h2>
<h3>Cross Channel Execution</h3>
<p>Deliver your messages to mobile app pushes, in store, ATM, web site, email, SMS, and any channel you can access via an api.  Barnes and Noble delivers 5 billion emails a year.</p>
<h3>Real Time Interaction Management</h3>
<p>Create offers from a central catalogue and embed them in any channel.  TMU, online sports betting uses the interaction management capability to deliver 13,000 unique recommendations per minute.</p>
<h3>Operational Reporting</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7151" alt="reports" src="https://blogs.perficient.com/portals/files/2014/03/reports.jpg" width="543" height="232" srcset="/adobe-blog/files/2014/03/reports.jpg 543w, /adobe-blog/files/2014/03/reports-300x128.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 543px) 100vw, 543px" /></p>

<h2>The Demo</h2>
<p>Stephan walked us through a demo using Jenny a marketer at Geometrixx. Amma is the customer who enjoys running and loves her iPad.</p>
<ul>
<li>Jenny logs into Adobe Campaign and creates a campaign for a product launch
<ul>
<li>Uses a template to create the campaign.</li>
<li>Template gives a pre-configured segmentation and workflow</li>
<li>Workflow was fairly complex and pushed messages to a variety of customers across many channel.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Emma received an email message in her inbox on her iPad.  It was of course, responsive
<ul>
<li>By clicking, she hit the landing page</li>
<li>Adobe Campaign gathered key information like the email open, clicking, etc.</li>
<li>Emma got a voucher as part of the offer and used the offer to hit the site to buy a pair of shoes</li>
<li>System automatically sent a confirmation message for the shoe receipt</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Jenny logs in and runs reports. She can get a lot of information like
<ul>
<li>overall program sucess</li>
<li>overall campaign success</li>
<li>who opened</li>
<li>What segments</li>
<li>By city, state, device, ROI (if you put costing in), etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Jenny looks at the customer profile
<ul>
<li>The profile shows all interactions, emails, buying patterns, opening email, accepting an offer, etc.</li>
<li>Showed profiling on social and other sites</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What&#8217;s Next?</p>
<ul>
<li>New release coming in Q3 2014</li>
<li>Will be embedded i Marketing Cloud</li>
<li>Will have a full web version</li>
<li>Will be integrated with all the solutions in the  marketing cloud</li>

<li>Much more graphical interface in reporting, workflow, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
<p>Are introducing a campaign management tool at <a href="http://adobecampaignpro.com">adobecampaignpro.com</a>.  This self-assessment helps you understand where you are.  Seven sections with five questions each gives you a score based on 35 total questions.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Mobile</h2>
<p>The Marketing Cloud will support mobile app assets.  It&#8217;s part of the unified digital assets services within the cloud.</p>
<ul>
<li>This new functionality lets you connect Phone Gap apps to the apps that are in the Marketing Cloud</li>
<li>Showed the list of Audi apps</li>
<li>Showed the Audi car configurator app which allowed the presenter to download and install the app directly to his phone.  Note: this was an app in production.
<ul>
<li>This process used to take days to get a dev app to someone&#8217;s phones</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Showed the app on multiple devices</li>
<li><strong>Really cool:</strong> He made one change to an existing app in the app store on the marketing cloud.  That change was pushed out to all the other devices in a real time manner.
<ul>
<li>I&#8217;m partially sold on their mobile approach</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The store integrates web analytics and campaign reporting info
<ul>
<li>Who downloads it</li>
<li>who launches</li>
<li>how it&#8217;s used</li>
<li>how campaigns worked</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Audi GM of Digital Strategy and Technology Jeff Titus</h2>
<p>Note: The demo used many different Audi apps.</p>
<p>Audi recognizes that the entire digital experience of our brand is important.  You need to relate to customers on their own terms.  You bring a good experience where they are.  Audi City is a virtual showroom that allows you to be very interactive.  In the show room, you work with a hi-res digital interface in very large screens.   Imagine building the car of your dreams and available in a larger than life experience at the dealership.   You get to pickup where the customer left off when they reach the show room floor.</p>
<p>Technology in the car</p>
<ul>
<li>Recognize that people have their devices and their own unique expectations</li>
<li>Picture navigation in the new A3</li>
<li>Facebook availalble but not while driving</li>
<li>Google maps navigation now part of the experience</li>
<li>Want to bring the technologies that make sense in the lifestyle of the customer</li>
</ul>
<p>The Audi A3 is geared towards Millennials. It will have a plugin hybrid version in 2013.</p>
<p>Continuous Delivery as a process.  To Audi it&#8217;s a revolution.  A developer commits an idea through a deployment pipeline through a series of automated tests.  Shaping the requirements you have in a way that can be actionable and can be turned into a series of tests.  If you can do this, it will save you a lot of money and a lot of time.   It&#8217;s a change. It&#8217;s a revolution.  Audi is practicing it on a daily basis.</p>
<h2>Julie Bornstein,  CMO of Sephora</h2>
<p>What have you seen change over time: from threat to brick and mortar stores to digital being a weapon.  Originally the internet was a one way street.  The stores would get feedback but not the sites.  Now, they have much more information and feedback online.  It&#8217;s much more complex than it used to be.  It&#8217;s no longer just an e-commerce site.<br />
Sephora uses a mobile app to serve as a bridge between online and the store.  It tracks past purchases, lets you read reviews when in a store, gives you the customer card, and sets up opportunities for more mobile interactions.  The Color IQ section in the iPad gives some education. The iPad is also avaiallble in the store.  QR codes work as well.</p>
<p>How does the organization help or hinder the digital process? In the last two years, they&#8217;ve realized what a critical asset it is.  They brought in an amazing technology team to do this.  They start with a consumer experience and then user their technical partner. The investment in the team has made them an asset.</p>
<p><strong>Quote</strong>: The CIO is my best friend.</p>
<p>Julie also noted the cross channel campaigns in stores, print, and online.  She is excited to use the Adobe tools as the continue down this path.</p>
<p>What advice do you give: There are three really interesting trends</p>
<ol>
<li>Globalization- Korean pop star creates a YouTube video and a week later boys in CA are singing it.  It makes a lot of the differences irrelevant to the consumer.  Skin care trends in China can come to the US very quickly</li>
<li>Personalization &#8211;</li>
<li>Content &#8211; the idea that content and commerce are coming together. The power of the consumer experience in any channel has become more important.</li>
</ol>
