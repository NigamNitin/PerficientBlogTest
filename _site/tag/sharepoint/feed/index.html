				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On September 12, 2013 Gartner released their latest <a title="Gartner Magic Quadrant for Horizontal Portals" href="http://www.gartner.com/technology/reprints.do?id=1-1K6VW2C&amp;ct=130913&amp;st=sb" target="_blank">Magic Quadrant report for horizontal portals</a>.  Overall, the Magic Quadrant hasn&#8217;t changed much from last year with the vendors staying in the same quadrant as they were in 2012 (yawn&#8230;).  You can see my blog post from 2012: <a title="Gartner Magic Quadrant: Horizontal Portals 2012" href="http://blogs.perficient.com/digitaltransformation/2012/10/04/gartner-magic-quadrant-horizontal-portals-2012/" target="_blank">Gartner Magic Quadrant: Horizontal Portals 2012.</a><img class="alignright" title="Gartner Magic Quadrant for Horizontal Portals 2013" alt="Gartner Magic Quadrant for Horizontal Portals 2013" src="http://imagesrv.gartner.com/reprints/249000/249060/249060_1.png" width="426" height="426" /></p>
<p>In the leader quadrant, Liferay has jumped ahead of SAP on the ability to execute scale, but the big three &#8211; IBM, Microsoft and Oracle &#8211; seem to be the same.</p>
<p>In the visionary quadrant, salesforce.com and Adobe are poised to bust into the leader quadrant, but haven&#8217;t been able to make the jump.</p>
<p>Like the other quadrants, there isn&#8217;t much movement amongst the other vendors.  Either they are all getting better at the same time or nobody is making significant improvements in Gartner&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>Customer experience, digital experience, customer engagement, and marketing integration have all been a focus of many of these vendors in the last couple of years.</p>
<p>IBM has been investing heavily in making WebSphere Portal a key component of its customer and digital experience strategy.</p>
<p>Likewise, Adobe and Oracle have been positioning their portal products as the foundation for customer experience suites.</p>
<p>Microsoft, on the other hand, has been focusing SharePoint more and more on the intranet experience.  While they do tout some of SharePoint&#8217;s external digital experience capabilities, Microsoft seems intent on excelling in the employee experience.</p>
<p>Salesforce&#8217;s push into the portal space seems pretty solid with a combination of Force.com and Chatter.  Many people still can&#8217;t make the leap from Salesforce being a CRM system to Salesforce being a horizontal portal, but it has lots of capabilities just waiting to be exploited.</p>
<p>I think I&#8217;d like to see added to the list more Web Content Management vendors who are offering portal and portal-like capabilities.  Sitecore comes to mind as a strong WCM vendor who could compete with many of these portal solutions.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gene Phifer spoke about the trends in what Gartner calls the User Experience Platform (UXP).  The big change from last year appears to be a split in the emerging UXP market into Suite vendors and Lean vendors.</p>
<p>Gartner sees many vendors, such as IBM, Microsoft, and Oracle expanding more and more into the Suite side of the market.  There are also emerging vendors in Suite side, including Adobe and Cisco.  On the lean side, we see vendors such as Liferay, Backbase, Drupal and DotNetNuke.</p>
<p>One of the key points I got out of Gene&#8217;s talk is to understand the ethos, or character, of the various vendor products.  Gene offers the following ethos for each vendor.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vendor -&gt; Ethos</strong></li>
<li>Adobe -&gt; Customer</li>
<li>Cisco -&gt; Collaboration</li>
<li>IBM -&gt; Customer; Employee</li>
<li>Oracle -&gt; Business Apps/Process</li>
<li>MS -&gt; Collaboration</li>
<li>SAP -&gt; Business Apps/Process</li>
</ul>
<p>The ethos doesn&#8217;t mean that a vendor can&#8217;t play in another space, but it may be more challenging.</p>
<p>Gene offers the follow strategies to address UXP in the future:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take inventory of portal and portal-like technologies and efforts in your enterprise</li>
<li>Establish governance early, including processes, teams and executive sponsorship</li>
<li>Improve design processes as precursor to UXP adoption</li>
<li>Gather Feedback from stakeholders</li>
<li>Capitalize on widget and gadget integration via RESTful approaches</li>
<li>Plan for an onslaught of mobile requirements</li>
<li>Verify Alignment with Portal Vendor strategies</li>
<li>Devise a framework and establish standards to address ongoing portal and UXP initiatives.</li>
<li>Look at new sourcing strategies: buy  vs build vs hosting vs cloud</li>
</ul>
<p>I asked about how Web Content Management vendors play in the UXP arena.  Gene responded that Personalization is really at the heart of a UXP.  Personalization is something portals do very well.  If you have a content management system that also does a good job of personalization, then that could be the basis of an excellent UXP platform.  See Adobe for an excellent example.  He thinks, and I agree, that we will see Web Content Management vendors becoming players in the UXP market.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On October 28, 2011, Gartner updated their <a title="2011 Magic Quadrant for Horizontal Portals" href="http://www.gartner.com/technology/reprints.do?id=1-17RTIFE&amp;ct=111025&amp;st=sg" target="_blank">Magic Quadrant for Horizontal Portals</a>. While not much has changed from 2010 in the leader&#8217;s<img class="alignright" title="2011 Magic Quadrant for Horizontal Portals " src="http://imagesrv.gartner.com/reprints/219200/219245/219245_1.png;pv0e19f9d91c2cf330" alt="2011 Magic Quadrant for Horizontal Portals " width="400" height="410" /> quadrant, there are a few new names on the chart in the other quadrants.  In the pictures here you can see the 2010 version compared to 2011.<a href="http://blogs.perficient.com/digitaltransformation/2011/10/31/gartner-magic-quadrant-for-horizontal-portals-2011/gart2010portals/" rel="attachment wp-att-3683"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3683" title="gart2010portals" src="https://blogs.perficient.com/digitaltransformation/files/2011/10/gart2010portals-292x300.png" alt="2010 Magic Quadrant for Horizontal Portals" width="292" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Microsoft, IBM and Oracle continue to be the top three leaders in Gartners research.  This hasn&#8217;t changed for several years now.</p>
<p>Liferay and SAP continue to be designated leaders in this space, although it appears that SAP is falling behind in it vision.</p>
<p>In the visionaries quadrant, new comers include Backbase, salesforce.com and OpenText.</p>
<p>Backbase was formerly considered a niche player as it has been used primarily in financial services companies.  Now it looks like Backbase is beginning to broaden both its portal capabilities as well as its market.</p>
<p>salesforce.com is a newcomer to the horizontal portal Magic Quadrant.  Gartner sees its strengths as already having good connections to other enterprise applications, good adoption by users, and its cloud expertise.  Cautions from Gartner include lack of marketing of salesforce.com as a horizontal portal and licensing costs.  Gartner recommends you ask for their high-volume pricing!</p>
<p>OpenText was previously in the Challenger quadrant.  With the move to the visionary quadrant, Gartner views them as less capable of executing but having an improved portal vision.  Indeed, Gartner says that OpenText customers say the products functionality and support have lagged behind the leaders.  OpenText comes from the former Vignette Portal and Epicentric products, so it does have a good pedigree.</p>
<p>In the Challenger&#8217;s quadrant is RedHat (JBoss) open source portal.  This is been a challenger for sometime, but has not been able to break through iton the leader category as Liferay has done.  JBoss portal has been popular in large enterprises who can afford to devote time to developing the platform.  JBoss still lacks a clear vision on whether it wants to be a leader in the portal space.</p>
<p>Finally, the Niche players include several new names and one old name.  New entries here include Drupal, DotNetNuke and edge IPK.  Drupal and DotNetNuke come from the Web Content Management space, but we are starting to see the emergence of WCM products as viable portal platforms.  Both products lack a comprehensive portal vision, but if they want to expand into horizontal portals, they have a chance to succeed.  I&#8217;m kind of surprised to not see Adobe CQ5 included alongside these other WCM vendors, as they have portal capabilities in that product too.</p>
<p>edge IPK has been traditionally in the mashup and RIA space.  But Gartner considers their EdgeConnect product to be a lean portal that emphasizes multichannel presentation.  Edge IPK is still a very small vendor, but Gartner thinks they are headed toward competing in the User Experience space.</p>
<p>Finally, Tibco has fallen from Visionary to Niche in the Magic Quadrant.  PortalBuilder is Tibco&#8217;s product and has not garnered much attention in the market.  If your company relies on Tibco&#8217;s outstanding SOA and integration products, you might look at PortalBuilder as a front end for that integration.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a <a title="Seismic shift in portal market" href="http://blogs.perficient.com/digitaltransformation/2011/03/29/gartner-pcc-gartner-predicts-siesmic-shift-in-portal-market-by-2015/" target="_blank">previous post</a>, I talked about Gartners prediction of a &#8220;seismic shift&#8221; in the portal market.  In one of the last session of the Gartner Portal, Content &amp; Collaboration 2011 Summit, Gene Phifer spoke about the future of portals.  Gene is convinced that the portal market (and mashup market) will be &#8220;subsumed&#8221; by a new User Experience Platform market around 2015.  There are plenty of reasons to see these markets moving to this new UXP market:</p>
<ul>
<li>Organizations are demanding better user experiences in their portals.</li>
<li>They see consumerization driving other products and want it for their portals.</li>
<li>Mobile devices and the need for context-awareness are being demanded by users</li>
</ul>
<p>What about cloud-based portals &#8211; is that in our future?  It certainly is!   Many vendors are starting to offer cloud-based portal systems. But beware!  The very nature of the portal is that it typically connects to a whole bunch of other systems in your organization behind your firewall.  So for a cloud-based portal to be effective, you will need to open up your internal systems to the cloud vendor and have some serious networking pipes. On the other hand, a cloud-based portal would be ideal to integrate your other cloud-based applications.</p>
<p>2015 is still a long way away, so what is happening between now and that future?  Here are the seven things that Gartner sees trending in the portal market over the next few years.</p>
<ul>
<li>Analytics need to be implemented to help gauge the effectiveness of the portal.  There has been a recent flurry of acquisitions in the Web Analytics market by traditional and newer portal vendors</li>
<li>Portal-less Portals &#8211; there are several vendors beginning to offer portal type systems without claiming to be true portals.  Backbase is considered one of those vendors.  <a title="Adobe CQ5" href="http://blogs.perficient.com/digitaltransformation/2011/03/07/adobe-cq5-has-arrived/" target="_blank">Adobe&#8217;s CQ5</a> could also qualify.</li>
<li>Portal ubiquity &#8211; portals will become more ubiquitous as unbind their services</li>
<li>Exploit context across more user attributes (aka enhanced personalization)</li>
<li>Widgets are becoming more important and portlets less-so</li>
<li>Mobile is becoming a key first consideration</li>
<li>The User Experience Platform begins to emerge as a set of cohesive, pre-integrated, highly user interactive services rather than a bunch of products loosely coupled together.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, in terms of vendors, we have basically three major portal vendors today:  IBM, Oracle, and Microsoft.  Close behind are our open source friends Liferay and JBoss. As the market begins to move toward this UXP concept, we are going to see lots of other vendors emerge with UXP offerings.  Firms from the content management space are beginning to move toward UXP, as are firms in the Social Software, Mashups, Portal-less Portals and other Markets.</p>
<p>Here are some vendors to keep your eye on over the next few years:</p>
<p>IBM, Oracle, Microsoft, Liferay, Redhat JBoss, Backbase, Adobe, Cisco, Google, Apple, United Planet, JackBe, NetVibes, Pageflakes, Fatwire, Extron, Automony, Drupal, DotNetNuke, Plone, Jive, Atlassian, Telligent, SocialText.</p>
