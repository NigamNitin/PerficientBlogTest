				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The theme is reinvention. Michael has reinvented himself many times. Starting with standup then on to comedy then on to more serious roles.  Then&#8230;&#8230;.. he was Batman.</p>
<p>A recap of today&#8217;s Adobe Summit interview:</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Did you steer your career or did you go with the flow?</p>
<p>I started something in college then dropped out. I had to start acting in comedy after I dropped out to get back to college.  I tried comedy at a Jazz club.  When I went to California the goal was to seek employment. In retrospect, standup comedy was really good for me.  I had a ton of interest but I needed a focus. Once I started to actually work in film, I focused and made a couple decisions early on to setup a career that I hoped that would be to my advantage.  It was doing as many things as you can.</p>
<p>There was never a master plan. There were strategic moves and a type of discipline that worked.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Let&#8217;s talk about Birdman. Congrats on the Oscar and Golden Globe.  A lot of people were surprised and sad that you didn&#8217;t win the Oscar for best actor? Why do you think you didn&#8217;t win?<span id="more-869"></span></p>
<p>uuhhhhhhhh&#8230;&#8230;.  The whole campaign for best actor was an interesting experience.  I had a good attitude about going in given all the previous wins. I like to be a competitor. But the point is that it was out of my control.  Michael wanted to do something to bring it back into control. (Play a game of one-on-one basketball)</p>
<p>Why I didn&#8217;t win: I don&#8217;t know but I will tell you that you need to think that you will win.  In this case, these awards don&#8217;t measure the degree of difficulty required for what was accomplished.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: A lot of folks are tech folks here.  You&#8217;ve done a lot of special effects, animation, etc. Do you think technology is helping or hurting films?</p>
<p>In the long run it&#8217;s helping. You can make films like Multiplicity so much faster and easier with technology.  It can be a challenge to play into green screens even though it opens up possibilities.</p>
<p>Take Beetlejuice.  If you were to make it again, you would run the risk of too much technology.  It&#8217;s so much more efficient now though.  It can add to the democratization of film making.</p>
<p>A lot of people can make films now. There is more opportunity for people to express themselves.  I always thought people would make a pretty good movie on their phone.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> What do you talk about in social?</p>
<p>I believe it&#8217;s an unbelievable tool in twitter.  I don&#8217;t tweet a lot.  I was fishing in the bahamas.  I asked my friend what he was doing and he replied, &#8220;I&#8217;m tweeting&#8221;  His friend showed the fisherman how twitter worked and helped the guy build his business as they relayed good places to fish, where they were, etc.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s less about what I ate for lunch.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> One of the way Marketing has changed is from the number of awards and then measuring yourself at the end of a campaign.  How do you measure your success?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not about the measurement of monetary wealth. For me it&#8217;s about professionally, how good can I get at what I want to be?</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> What&#8217;s your &#8220;place?&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s Montana. I feel the most at home there.  I love the outside. The West always held a fascination. I took a trip to the west and I was done. I love the space and the entire feel.</p>
