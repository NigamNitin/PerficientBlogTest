				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/thomas-boudalier/0/626/42a">Thomas Boudalier</a>, VP of Engineering for Adobe Campaign and <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/laxalt">Francois Laxalt</a>, Senior Product Manager, both gave a session on where Adobe Campaign is going in the next little bit. While we saw some demos of a fully integrated Marketing Cloud including Adobe Campaign, we know it hasn&#8217;t been released yet.  Of course, those in the audience wanted to know about more than just a SaaS version. Marketing automation is seeing a lot of change so Adobe Campaign has more to show.</p>
<h2>Trends, What&#8217;s Next for Cross-Channel Marketing</h2>
<p>Francois started with a number of trends driving change in the industry.</p>
<h3>Empowered Consumer</h3>
<p>This is the era of the empowered consumer and you have to EARN their trust.</p>
<p><strong>Stats: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>54% of consumers don&#8217;t trust ads they see. (Forrester)</li>
<li>70% feel that your attempts at personalization are superficial</li>
</ul>
<p>Consumers also want more options for privacy and how much you interact with them.</p>
<h3>Channel Proliferation</h3>
<p>With the digitzation of marketing, addressable channel have proliferated.  Large companies like P&amp;G plan to shift their ad spend to addressable channels.  At the same time, legacy channels like TV are becoming more addressable.</p>
<p>New channels</p>
<ul>
<li>Video game consoles and video games</li>
<li>Cars</li>
<li>Once cars become addressable then almost anything can become a channel</li>
</ul>
<h3>Content offer Optimization</h3>
<p>You have a couple challenges</p>
<ol>
<li>It has to be real time</li>
<li>You have to deal with lots of formats (format deluge)
<ol>
<li>Many start in one channel and move to another to complete the transaction</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Contextualization
<ol>
<li>Now you need to know where a person started, where they are now, and how to keep the exxperience moving.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Data Conundrum</h3>
<p>All the channels, CRM, third party data, websites, and a marketing database gives you a lot of data.</p>
<p><strong>Stat</strong>: In 2011 71% of CMOS said they felt underprepared to deal with the data explosion. Now that statistic is 80% (IBM)</p>
<p>First party data is king.  It delivers the best ROI, allows you to match anonymous and known data, and you own the data.</p>
<h3>Automation and Orchestration</h3>
<p>Adobe Campaign rides the cusp of this trend.</p>
<h2>Adobe Campaign</h2>
<p>Marketing is where the action is right now. They follow a couple of driving philosophies</p>
<ol>
<li>User Experience. Create applications for people not just engineers</li>
<li>Digital Data Deluge &#8211; must handle large amounts of data</li>
<li>Security &#8211; It must be a priority</li>
<li>Integration and Extensibility. Make it all work together within the Adobe Marketing Cloud.  Allow for the use of the tools in new ways with open api&#8217;s</li>
<li>Functional Features &#8211; in other words, deliver key functions like visual campaign, mobile support, an integrated customer profile, etc.</li>
</ol>
<h3>What&#8217;s Next</h3>
<p>.Next is the next generation of Adobe Campaign.  Goal number one is to make it a first class member of the Marketing Cloud.  At the same time, they want to continue as a first class campaign product</p>
<p>Demo time: Note that this was the alpha version.  It&#8217;s due out in Q3</p>
<ul>
<li>New version reflects the Marketing Cloud look and feel. Black and white, simple interface</li>
<li>It&#8217;s web based, not client like previous versions</li>
<li>They changed up some labels, probably to match the labels of the cloud</li>
<li>Overview screen shows a dashboard of options</li>
<li>Customer profiles are part of the integrated customer profile
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s an updated UI</li>
<li>Contains images, maps to location, all interactions with customer, by inbound and outbound</li>
<li>Includes a timeline</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Audiences
<ul>
<li>Otherwise known as targets or segmentation</li>
<li>Shows a number of out of the box segments</li>
<li>Creating new audiences or segments has a simple UI to combine existing audiences, adding new filters, etc.</li>
<li>Audience now synchronizes with the rest of the marketing cloud.  So all your segmentation is usable by all the tools</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Data Feeds
<ul>
<li>This other data section includes a nice interface to see your CRM feed, syncing with purchased records, etc.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s where the ETL tools are</li>
<li>The enrichment of data make them part of the master marketing profile (MMP)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Campaign execution
<ul>
<li>New look, based on cards</li>
<li>Completely updated UI. Very modern, no old Windows look</li>
<li>The same metadata is there of course</li>
<li>Editing tools for emails are embedded into the Activity, not separate</li>
<li>The program, campaign, activity hierarchy remains but with the clean card interface</li>
<li>One campaign may have multiple activities across different channels</li>
<li>The workflow UI is completely udpated although the icons retain some similarity with previous versions.  Queries, Splits, Email rules, etc remain the same.
<ul>
<li>As the workflow runs, it can accept data from other parts of the marketing cloud. That enters in the workflow stream for the &#8220;real-time&#8221; part of the marketing promise.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Made a reference to kicking Exact Target in the behind</li>
<li>Channels include (notice the new channel direct to other Adobe products)
<ul>
<li>email delivery</li>
<li>landig page</li>
<li>sms</li>
<li>social networks</li>
<li>adobe social</li>
<li>adobe target</li>
<li>adobe media optimizer</li>
<li>direct mail</li>
<li>Mobile notification</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Calendar view
<ul>
<li>Shows all programs, campaigns, activities.</li>
<li>This functionality existed before but the UI is completely redone and now allows search</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reports are updated. The extend of reports looks the same but they show a dashboard now.
<ul>
<li>Dashboard is new, it shows key data on your running campaign</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mobile
<ul>
<li>Showed the tablet version live</li>
<li>Pretty much the same interface</li>
<li>Designed as &#8220;touch first&#8221;  so it works in the tablet in the same fashion as it would work on the laptop</li>
<li>Supports different orientation as well</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Patrick Tripp and Stephane Bline presented on Adobe Campaign (formerly Neolane)</p>
<p>They started off with a video on key information you know about customers like:</p>
<ul>
<li>bought 5 concert tickets</li>
<li>is a season ticket holder</li>
<li>opened but did not click season renewal</li>
<li>How he bought his tickets
<ul>
<li>2 at the door</li>
<li>3 online</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Cross-Channel marketing is about understanding the preference of the consumer and determining how you can engage with them.</p>
<p>Adobe Campaign brings the data together to deliver a personalized experience via a variety of channel.  You treat different segmented consumers differently based on their known interests and preferred channels.</p>
<p><strong>Quote:</strong> There is no such thing as a one size fits all approach to customer engagement anymore.</p>
<h2>The Solution</h2>
<p>It delivers six unique capabilities</p>
<ol>
<li>Integrated Customer Profile</li>
<li>Targeted Segmentation</li>
<li>Visual Campaign Orchestration</li>
<li>Cross-channel execution</li>
<li>Real-time interaction management</li>
<li>Operational reporting</li>
</ol>
<h3>Integrated Customer profile</h3>
<p>This is the life blood of Adobe Campaign.  It&#8217;s central to everything they do with Adobe Campaign. Match.com knows more about their members than anyone else.   They store the profile of every consumer. They use it to deliver messages in real time.  They send millions of messages a day.</p>
<h3>Target Segmentation</h3>
<p>Use the profile  to drive one-to-one personalization.  It enhances the effectiveness of marketing.</p>
<h3>Visual Campaign Orchestration</h3>
<p>Use the segmentation, data, and workflow to create the interaction with the customer.</p>

<h3>Cross Channel Execution</h3>
<p>Deliver your messages to mobile app pushes, in store, ATM, web site, email, SMS, and any channel you can access via an api.  Barnes and Noble delivers 5 billion emails a year.</p>
<h3>Real Time Interaction Management</h3>
<p>Create offers from a central catalogue and embed them in any channel.  TMU, online sports betting uses the interaction management capability to deliver 13,000 unique recommendations per minute.</p>
<h3>Operational Reporting</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7151" alt="reports" src="https://blogs.perficient.com/portals/files/2014/03/reports.jpg" width="543" height="232" srcset="/adobe-blog/files/2014/03/reports.jpg 543w, /adobe-blog/files/2014/03/reports-300x128.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 543px) 100vw, 543px" /></p>

<h2>The Demo</h2>
<p>Stephan walked us through a demo using Jenny a marketer at Geometrixx. Amma is the customer who enjoys running and loves her iPad.</p>
<ul>
<li>Jenny logs into Adobe Campaign and creates a campaign for a product launch
<ul>
<li>Uses a template to create the campaign.</li>
<li>Template gives a pre-configured segmentation and workflow</li>
<li>Workflow was fairly complex and pushed messages to a variety of customers across many channel.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Emma received an email message in her inbox on her iPad.  It was of course, responsive
<ul>
<li>By clicking, she hit the landing page</li>
<li>Adobe Campaign gathered key information like the email open, clicking, etc.</li>
<li>Emma got a voucher as part of the offer and used the offer to hit the site to buy a pair of shoes</li>
<li>System automatically sent a confirmation message for the shoe receipt</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Jenny logs in and runs reports. She can get a lot of information like
<ul>
<li>overall program sucess</li>
<li>overall campaign success</li>
<li>who opened</li>
<li>What segments</li>
<li>By city, state, device, ROI (if you put costing in), etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Jenny looks at the customer profile
<ul>
<li>The profile shows all interactions, emails, buying patterns, opening email, accepting an offer, etc.</li>
<li>Showed profiling on social and other sites</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What&#8217;s Next?</p>
<ul>
<li>New release coming in Q3 2014</li>
<li>Will be embedded i Marketing Cloud</li>
<li>Will have a full web version</li>
<li>Will be integrated with all the solutions in the  marketing cloud</li>
<li>Improves the interface. Much cleaner, less Windows like</li>
<li>Much more graphical interface in reporting, workflow, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
<p>Are introducing a campaign management tool at <a href="http://adobecampaignpro.com">adobecampaignpro.com</a>.  This self-assessment helps you understand where you are.  Seven sections with five questions each gives you a score based on 35 total questions. It lets you benchmark yourself based on what your peers in your industry are doing.</p>
<p>They have a broader digital marketing maturity model as well.</p>
