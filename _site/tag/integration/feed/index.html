				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a different session one of the speakers said there is a fine line between understanding customer sentiment and being creepy.  To get insight, you have to monitor what they say, what the do on your site and others&#8217;.  But you don&#8217;t want to go too far and cross that creepy line.</p>
<p>In this session Craig Stoe and Andrew Bolander spoke about this topic.  You can use Adobe Social to gain customer insight. These insights should lead to developing stronger relationships with customers and delivering more consistent experiences.  </p>
<p><a href="/adobe-blog/files/2014/03/20140325-173805.jpg"><img src="/adobe-blog/files/2014/03/20140325-173805.jpg" alt="20140325-173805.jpg" class="alignnone size-full" /></a></p>
<p>What is social data?<br />
&#8211; engagement data is what is going on with the customer<br />
&#8211; listening data are brand relevant keywords, sentiment, influencers<br />
&#8211; attribution data is what we can learn about the customer personal attributes</p>
<p>Start with discovery.  This is where you mine data about customers.  Next is explore.  Here you start to look for more engagement data. At the buy stage, customers express buying signals and you need to pick up on these to make offers.   All this data can lead to better engagement. </p>
<p>A social profile helps you collect all this data so you have a better view of the customer.  Adobe has developed a scoring algorithm that can be assigned.  This consists of measuring User Class, Supporter index, Buzz and User Distribution.  These measures lead to a composite score that can be used to target customers. </p>
<p>Andrew presented 5 steps to implement and use the social profile.<br />
1. Listen<br />
2. Prioritize<br />
3. Engage properly<br />
4. Gather insights<br />
5. Share insights</p>
<p>He presented a live demo of Adobe Social and how to build and use the social profile through tweets from the audience. </p>
<p>For listening, you create listening rules that help you filter across the social platforms, hashtags, and attributes. </p>
<p>In prioritization, you can set up automation rules to route content around the organization.  You can also apply segments and tags to results of the rules. </p>
<p>When it comes time to engage, you use Unified Moderation, which places multiple platforms under one screen so you can moderate multiple systems at the same time. Moderators can claim content, retweet, respond, and close out the item as handled.  By claiming content, you prevent others from working on ending up with duplicate responses. </p>
<p>The social profile is connected to the moderation screen and you can review a users profile attributes.  The system can also pull together different accounts into one profile.  So one profile could link you twitter data with your Facebook data.</p>
<p>The social profile provides the customer insights, including emotion scores, sentiment scores, tracking of previous interactions and more. </p>
<p>As a final piece, Andrew showed how Adobe Social integrates and shares with the Adobe Marketing Cloud. For example, if a user logs into your AEM site using a Facebook login, their actions on the site can contribute to their social profile.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thomas Stober, IBM Lead Architect WebSphere Portal Foundation, gave a presentation at IBM Connect 2013 titled &#8220;Enhance WebSphere Portal Delivery with Real time Active Analytics Insights&#8221;.   Of course, site analytics tracks user interaction with your site and can be a key input to help you optimize your portal design.  It also can play an important role in personalization of the site for each user by tracking what they do on the site.</p>
<p>WebSphere Portal Active Site Analytics (ASA) framework is used to integrate third party analytics tools which  analyze web site visitor demographics and interaction patterns. ASA is built-in to WebSphere Portal, making it easy for you to integrate one of the many analytic tools into the overall experience.</p>
<p>Portal does not provide the analytics engine &#8211; that is provided by systems such as CoreMetrics, WebTrends, Unica and Adobe SiteCatalyst.  Portal ships with tag aggregators for CoreMetrics and Unica.  It also includes a generic aggregator that can be updated easily for other vendors.  These aggregators pull the analytic data from the page and sends it to one of the analytic systems.  You can add your own tags to a page to provide even more insights into the user behavior.<img class="alignright" alt="" src="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/blogs/WebAnalytics/resource/BLOGS_UPLOADED_IMAGES/ASAOverview.png" width="309" height="275" /><a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;docid=seGDyL8sZPzo-M&amp;tbnid=ZGqkasoMyKvDpM:&amp;ved=0CAgQjRwwAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ibm.com%2Fdeveloperworks%2Fmydeveloperworks%2Fblogs%2FWebAnalytics%2Fentry%2Foverview_of_active_site_analytics_in_websphere_portal_711&amp;ei=Ni8IUcSNDZPq8gTqh4HwCw&amp;psig=AFQjCNFHIaNjv5wwJfARjn60Nx2DHdvqaA&amp;ust=1359577270281890"><br />
</a></p>
<p>The analytics systems are used to generate reports and analysis that marketers and business users can review.  To make it very easy to view the analytics reports and charts, Portal provides a mechanism to view those reports directly on the page and in context of the various items on the page.  So you can go to a specific content area on the page and directly view the analytics report/chart for that content. This is shown in the picture below.<a href="https://blogs.perficient.com/portals/files/2013/01/asa.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5952 alignright" alt="asa" src="https://blogs.perficient.com/portals/files/2013/01/asa-300x182.png" width="300" height="182" srcset="/adobe-blog/files/2013/01/asa-300x182.png 300w, /adobe-blog/files/2013/01/asa-768x467.png 768w, /adobe-blog/files/2013/01/asa-600x365.png 600w, /adobe-blog/files/2013/01/asa.png 1376w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Thomas showed several IBM Digital Marketing Optimization solution examples and also covered how to use ASA to:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px"><span id="more-5951"></span>integrate third party web analytics aggregator scripts to web portal and content pages </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">collect real-time data for analysis</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">out-of-box reporting</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">campaign management options</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">New in WebSphere Portal 8 are even better inline marketing overlays, which provide business and marketing people direct, real-time views of sub-page level data, including portlets, and content items.  These overlays make it easy to see user behavior for analysis and then use this information to drive results. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">The important point for us is that site analytics is no longer just reports on how many people hit our site and what pages were viewed most.  Active Site Analytics has now evolved into accessing real-time insights into the usage patterns of your Web Experience platform.  Once you capture usage data you can then optimize delivery of your marketing messages to your audiences through multiple channels,  enhanced by high capability campaign management systems, such as the IBM Marketing Center.  </span></p>
