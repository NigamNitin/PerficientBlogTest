				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Highlights from Adobe Summit&#8217;s Day 2 session with Steve Young and Collin Resch:</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> If you were still playing, would you throw to Richard Sherman?</p>
<p>In college, everyone was open. In the pros, no one was open.  To me, I don&#8217;t care who is out there. If you are open, you are getting the football. If you are covered, probably not.  Part of performing is finding out how good you are.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Did you cringe at throwing to one side of the field?</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t want to give into that.  You don&#8217;t want to avoid competition.  It feels kind of creepy.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Analytics and predictions goes hand in hand with this.  You have a different mindset.<span id="more-867"></span></p>
<p>I met with this company called predictive DNA. He said by DNA he could figure out if you would be a good athlete or not. I hated that. Think of what it would mean to a 10 year old Steve Young.  Pretty soon, we are a bunch of mice in a wheel.</p>
<p>I know it&#8217;s useful. I do like predictive technology. I just don&#8217;t want to be trapped by it.</p>
<p><strong>Point:</strong> You invented yourself even in high school. You threw a no-hitter in baseball actually.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t drink and I threw that the day after senior prom so take that in context&#8230;&#8230;.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> You are known as a running quarterback.  You go to BYU, a throwing team.  You reinvent yourself. You take a round about way to the NFL. You then hit San Francisco with a key emphasis on accuracy. Obviously you know how to reinvent yourself.</p>
<p>I learned how to throw the football when I was in college.  Then I learned how to be accurate. But in the pros, you have to open up your visibility.  I learned quickly that I wasn&#8217;t very tall compared to other quarterbacks.   Key quote: You better start seeing the open guy.  The job demands 6&#8242; 5&#8243;. So what do you do?  Wear high heels?  I finally realized that I know where Jerry is going so throw it where you think Jerry Rice is.  I started to throw the ball blind.  Jerry started to catch the ball.</p>
<p>Jerry&#8217;s advice: Steve, just put it in my chest.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: What are the searing memories of your career?</p>
<p>Throwing the ball blind.  When he catches it then I can say, &#8220;I&#8217;m taller&#8221;  Steve gave an example of throwing the ball blind and getting dog piled. Hearing the crowd go silent he knew that Jerry Rice caught it.  That was a great moment.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t reinvent yourself. You just figure out other ways to deliver.  Figure out other ways to be agile and responsive. There&#8217;s nothing that makes you old than not knowing what&#8217;s happening in technology. I buy that new thing.  I don&#8217;t want to hear that this is a 20 something generation.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: As CEO of a global capital firm you said, &#8220;I want to know as a private equity guy who use to play ball.&#8221;  Why?</p>
<p>I got my law degree while winning three Super Bowls. The teachers didn&#8217;t care.  My dad said to prepare for your next life.  In the NFL it&#8217;s over at 38.  I just humbled myself and go back to school so I can be good at something after the NFL.  I never knew there were so many common denominators between sports and business.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not buying a company, I&#8217;m buying them. Invest in someone. Trust them.  It&#8217;s a different world with no clock and no score but it&#8217;s still a great ride.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Let&#8217;s talk about the final play and Nate Silver and stats.  You listen to all these stats and the final play of the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>This is what&#8217;s wrong with data. Numbers never lie but they never tell the whole truth either.  There are zero percent of throws from the 1/2 yard line inside of the tackle box.  You have to be careful. Everything is contextual.</p>
<p><strong>Quote</strong>: You have to royally screw up on multiple levels to lose.</p>
<p><strong>Quote</strong>: If the ultimate guy is not accountable then that&#8217;s a bad thing.</p>
