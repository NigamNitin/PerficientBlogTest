				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Did you know that <a href="http://landing.adobe.com/en/na/solutions/experience-manager/188465-mobile-consumer-study.html" target="_blank">45% of consumers</a> are less than satisfied with their experience on digital channels?</p>
<p>What’s lurking behind this customer experience issue? There are a number of reasons, and data fragmentation is among them.</p>
<p>Consider for a moment at how fast data is growing each day. Worldwide <a href="https://www.emc.com/leadership/digital-universe/2014iview/executive-summary.htm" target="_blank">digital data</a> grows exponentially, and it’s expected to double every two years. What’s surprising is that only <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2015/09/30/big-data-20-mind-boggling-facts-everyone-must-read/#ea81e1b6c1d3" target="_blank">0.5%</a> of it is ever analyzed.</p>
<p>The profound volume and types of data created is a blessing and a curse for marketers. There’s an opportunity to harness this information, using it to make data-driven business decisions and providing more personalized experiences.</p>
<p>Data silos are among the top obstacles for marketers – where data lives and how it integrates with other systems so it can be accessed and used by the people who need it.</p>
<p>Other challenges involve technology and people. Many organizations lack the right analytics tools and people with the right skills or training that can turn data into insights.</p>
<p>How do you overcome this? And more importantly, how can you improve the 45% of consumers who aren’t satisfied with their experience?</p>
<p>When you employ a digital marketing platform like Adobe Marketing Cloud, you will be able to track, analyze, and report on customers’ activities across digital marketing channels – not just what happens on your website.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>“Marketers are no longer in the business of selling products – we are selling experiences.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The proliferation of technology, such as smartphones and the Internet of Things, make it possible to engage with customers on a one-to-one basis. However, the challenge is meeting their expectations to provide continuous, consistent, and compelling experiences both digitally and in reality.</p>
<p>Clients often come to us with the same three digital marketing challenges that can be solved with a solid marketing technology platform. Our latest guide, <strong>“<a href="http://www.perficient.com/Thought-Leadership/White-Papers/2016/Solve-Three-Common-Digital-Marketing-Challenges-with-Adobe-Marketing-Cloud" target="_blank">Solve Three Common Digital Marketing Challenges with Adobe Marketing Cloud</a>,”</strong> explores the underlying factors that impact customer experience and how the right digital marketing platform can help you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exceed customer expectations in B2B and B2C</li>
<li>Create a seamless customer experience across all channels</li>
<li>Use analytics to make data-driven marketing decisions</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lots of excitement during the first full day of Adobe Summit 2016! Was it just me, or did your brain feel like it couldn’t hold any more information at the end of the day?</p>
<p>Among 10,000+ Summit attendees, I was blown away by the announcements and demos during the General Session. Here are the highlights, in case you missed the livestream or didn’t follow along on Twitter:</p>
<p><strong>“This is the Experience Era.”</strong></p>
<p>This eloquently sums up the opening remarks made by Shantanu Narayen, CEO of Adobe. According to Narayen, experiences will be the competitive differentiator for businesses. Experiences start with great content and are powered by data.</p>
<div id="attachment_3190" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="/adobe-blog/files/2016/03/AdobeSummit_BradRencher_Experience_Photo.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-3190"><img class="wp-image-3190 size-medium" src="/adobe-blog/files/2016/03/AdobeSummit_BradRencher_Experience_Photo-300x169.jpg" alt="AdobeSummit_BradRencher_Experience_Photo" width="300" height="169" srcset="/adobe-blog/files/2016/03/AdobeSummit_BradRencher_Experience_Photo-300x169.jpg 300w, /adobe-blog/files/2016/03/AdobeSummit_BradRencher_Experience_Photo.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo by Beth Martin, @betz826</p></div>
<p>Brad Rencher, Executive Vice President of Adobe, echoed this in his talk: “We’re in the third wave of digital transformation for the enterprise, and it’s about the consumer experience.”</p>
<p>He talked about the four success factors for creating great experiences:</p>
<ol>
<li>Know and respect me</li>
<li>Speak in one voice</li>
<li>Make technology transparent</li>
<li>Delight me at every turn</li>
</ol>
<p><span id="more-3189"></span>Rencher also said, “The experience wave is about goosebumps, smiles, and bringing people closer together. It’s the marketer’s job to close the gap between people and the things they want. Then get out of the way.”</p>

<p>Did you ever wonder why McDonald’s started offering breakfast all day? During Rencher’s engaging discussion with Deborah Wahl, CMO of McDonald’s, we learned that the customer was at the heart of this decision.</p>
<p>And when it came to embracing digital in their business model, such as the McDonald’s app or ordering food using a kiosk, Wahl had this to say:</p>
<p>“In digital, there are a lot of shiny toys. We had to focus on timing and balance to get the experience right. We identified the biggest customer need first and provided offers before embracing the ‘shiny objects.’”</p>
<p>McDonald’s mobile app launch mid-year in 2015, and since then, the business has already seen 10 million downloads.</p>
<p>“We’re on a quick journey to be in line with our customer,” Wahl stated.</p>

<p>In the final segment of the General Session, David Nuescheler, VP of Enterprise Technology at Adobe, demonstrated the possibilities of connecting mobile technology in the physical world.</p>
<p>From using your smartphone – with your purchase preferences – to click and confirm your order at a with a Dunkin Donuts kiosk…</p>
<p>To placing your drive-thru order using your in-car connection – even a Tesla!</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to what’s in store for Day 2, and I would love to know what stood out to you among all the information shared during Day 1.</p>

<p>Many of us might answer smartphone, tablet, eReader, or wearable device (like our smartwatches or FitBits). This rampant proliferation of technology has opened our eyes to the possibilities of customer engagement.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder that capitalizing on analytics is a top priority for marketers. According to a recent Forbes article:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>89% of marketers have predictive analytics on their roadmap for 2016</strong></li>
<li><strong>49% use predictive analytics today</strong></li>
<li><strong>40% plan to implement analytics</strong> <strong>in the next 12 months</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In our interview series with Robert Sumner, principal of Perficient’s Adobe practice, we talked about the <a href="http://blogs.perficient.com/digexplatforms/2016/03/11/what-is-the-path-to-personalize-your-digital-marketing/" target="_blank">path to personalization</a> and the challenges of implementing a <a href="http://blogs.perficient.com/digexplatforms/2016/03/16/what-are-the-biggest-personalization-challenges/" target="_blank">personalization strategy</a>.</p>
<p>However, the insights gained from analytics make it possible to create engaging, personalized experiences. Sumner shares his perspective on analytics:</p>

In fact, <strong><a href="https://econsultancy.com/reports/quarterly-digital-intelligence-briefing-2016-digital-trends/" target="_blank">94% of marketers</a></strong> recognize that <strong>improving content creation and delivery processes</strong> are key to a great customer experience.</p>
<p>Aligning the right people, technology, and funding to create such an experience isn’t an easy task. With the help of a partner, like Perficient, your digital marketing journey can be smoother – and even enjoyable!</p>
<p>Earlier this week, we announced our sponsorship and participation at the upcoming <a href="http://www.perficient.com/About/News-Releases/2016/Adobe-Summit-2016" target="_blank">Adobe Summit</a>, where we’re helping enterprises “Navigate the Next.”</p>

<p>“Adobe has the very best solutions for solving such issues, and we bring those solutions to life,” she stated.</p></blockquote>

Proper planning is necessary, but executing a digital strategy isn’t as easy as flipping a switch.</p>
<p>In our discussion, we also talked about creating personalization scenarios and the implications of this at time of deployment. One of the challenges many companies face is that they tend to have multiple target audience segments which then requires multiple personalization scenarios.</p>
<p>Sumner expands on this thought here:</p>
<p><span id="more-3104"></span>Additionally, a report from <a href="https://www.webtrends.com/blog/2015/09/what-stands-in-the-way-of-digital-marketing/" target="_blank">Webtrends</a> reveals that digital marketers face other challenges when it comes to implementing a personalization strategy:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of organizational alignment and unclear priorities &#8211; </strong>76% of marketers stated this is the biggest hurdle preventing them from achieving digital marketing objectives.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Limited marketing budgets &#8211; </strong>68% of companies stated lack of funds is an issue, even though an increasing proportion of their marketing budgets are slated for digital strategy.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scarce skills and resources &#8211; </strong>66% of companies believe they don’t have enough people to meet their digital marketing goals, and 57% stated that lack of digital marketing expertise of their current staff stands in their way.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Available technology &#8211; </strong>62% of marketers said that not having the right technology in place prevents them from delivering a personalized experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>With the evolution of social media platforms and the explosion of mobile technology use, you’re well aware that creating personalized, 1 to 1 interactions with the customer is essential to remain competitive.</p>
<p>You don’t have to go it alone on your digital marketing journey.

As the number of digital experience platforms between brands and consumers continue to increase, we can also expect to the number of touch points to rise.</p>
<p>With the evolution of social media and the explosion of mobile technology, most marketers are well aware that their future success depends upon creating personalized, 1 to 1 interactions with the customer.</p>
<p>Transitioning from siloed marketing efforts to one that’s connected and personalized to the individual is not for the faint of heart. <a href="https://www.webtrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Webtrends_P2P_Infographic_FullSize_Digital.png" target="_blank">Webtrends</a> outlines the path to personalization in four stages:</p>
<ol>
<li>Apply basic context to influence personalization</li>
<li>Use specific in-session behaviors to influence content</li>
<li>Leverage in-session behaviors with historical behaviors</li>
<li>Achieve 1:1 personalization using predictive analysis</li>
</ol>
<p><span id="more-3091"></span></p>
<p>I recently spoke with Robert Sumner, principal of Perficient’s Adobe practice, to learn more about personalization and where marketers can begin on this journey. Check out the <a href="https://youtu.be/AYOlSzUWIsk" target="_blank">video</a> for more:</p>
