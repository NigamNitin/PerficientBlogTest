				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gene Phifer spoke about the trends in what Gartner calls the User Experience Platform (UXP).  The big change from last year appears to be a split in the emerging UXP market into Suite vendors and Lean vendors.</p>
<p>Gartner sees many vendors, such as IBM, Microsoft, and Oracle expanding more and more into the Suite side of the market.  There are also emerging vendors in Suite side, including Adobe and Cisco.  On the lean side, we see vendors such as Liferay, Backbase, Drupal and DotNetNuke.</p>
<p>One of the key points I got out of Gene&#8217;s talk is to understand the ethos, or character, of the various vendor products.  Gene offers the following ethos for each vendor.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vendor -&gt; Ethos</strong></li>
<li>Adobe -&gt; Customer</li>
<li>Cisco -&gt; Collaboration</li>
<li>IBM -&gt; Customer; Employee</li>
<li>Oracle -&gt; Business Apps/Process</li>
<li>MS -&gt; Collaboration</li>
<li>SAP -&gt; Business Apps/Process</li>
</ul>
<p>The ethos doesn&#8217;t mean that a vendor can&#8217;t play in another space, but it may be more challenging.</p>
<p>Gene offers the follow strategies to address UXP in the future:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take inventory of portal and portal-like technologies and efforts in your enterprise</li>
<li>Establish governance early, including processes, teams and executive sponsorship</li>
<li>Improve design processes as precursor to UXP adoption</li>
<li>Gather Feedback from stakeholders</li>
<li>Capitalize on widget and gadget integration via RESTful approaches</li>
<li>Plan for an onslaught of mobile requirements</li>
<li>Verify Alignment with Portal Vendor strategies</li>
<li>Devise a framework and establish standards to address ongoing portal and UXP initiatives.</li>
<li>Look at new sourcing strategies: buy  vs build vs hosting vs cloud</li>
</ul>
<p>I asked about how Web Content Management vendors play in the UXP arena.  Gene responded that Personalization is really at the heart of a UXP.  Personalization is something portals do very well.  If you have a content management system that also does a good job of personalization, then that could be the basis of an excellent UXP platform.  See Adobe for an excellent example.  He thinks, and I agree, that we will see Web Content Management vendors becoming players in the UXP market.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Forrester recently release their <a href="http://www.forrester.com/rb/Research/wave%26trade%3B_web_content_management_for_online_customer/q/id/58958/t/2">Web Content Management Wave</a>.  It&#8217;s striking less for the rankings and more for the information about trends and why they ranked the vendors the way they did.  I won&#8217;t reveal the Wave itself since I don&#8217;t have rights to distribute but I will note a few key findings.</p>
<h2>Welcome to CXM</h2>
<p>One of the key things they note is that WCM has evolved.  I&#8217;ve blogged before about <a href="http://blogs.perficient.com/digitaltransformation/?p=1994">WCM evolving towards portal</a>.  Forrester takes a larger view and show how WCM includes much more than just some portal and WCM functionality.  It also includes search, analytics, campaign management, and even some commerce functions.</p>
<div id="attachment_2743" style="width: 639px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/adobe-blog/files/2011/07/ForresterCXM.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-2743" title="ForresterCXM" src="https://blogs.perficient.com/portals/files/2011/07/ForresterCXM.png" alt="" width="629" height="559" srcset="/adobe-blog/files/2011/07/ForresterCXM.png 629w, /adobe-blog/files/2011/07/ForresterCXM-300x267.png 300w, /adobe-blog/files/2011/07/ForresterCXM-600x533.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Forrester&#039;s expanded view of web content called customer experience management (CXM)</p></div>
<p><span id="more-2742"></span></p>
<p>So Customer Experience Management (CXM) definitely takes a large view and it&#8217;s one I&#8217;m seeing with a lot of customers.  They demand a lot more from a customer facing web site.  They want things like:</p>
<h2><a href="/adobe-blog/files/2011/07/ForresterWCMPlans.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2745" title="ForresterWCMPlans" src="https://blogs.perficient.com/portals/files/2011/07/ForresterWCMPlans.png" alt="" width="638" height="665" srcset="/adobe-blog/files/2011/07/ForresterWCMPlans.png 638w, /adobe-blog/files/2011/07/ForresterWCMPlans-288x300.png 288w, /adobe-blog/files/2011/07/ForresterWCMPlans-576x600.png 576w, /adobe-blog/files/2011/07/ForresterWCMPlans-300x313.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 638px) 100vw, 638px" /></a>So who is important in the Wave?</h2>
<p>The two key winners in the wave are SDL Tridion and Adobe CQ5.  I don&#8217;t have much information on either but here&#8217;s a quick view into what Forrester says,</p>
<blockquote><p>SDL and Adobe lead due to breadth of functionality, market momentum, and track record. Both Adobe and SDL provides a solid set of tools aimed at enabling business users to manage experiences. SDL’s globalization and localization functionality remains a differentiator and has the potential to be an asset for mobile website management. Adobe has an excellent offering in terms of technology and features, and its integration with other Adobe-owned CXM<br />
components shows potential.</p></blockquote>
<p>Personally, I&#8217;m seeing a lot of interest in Adobe Cq5. It represents about 5% of the search hits on our blog site for example.</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting that IBM, Oracle, and Microsoft were all ranked lower as strong contenders but they were not as strong as CXM vendors.  I find this funny because both IBM and Microsoft actually had some major updates to their WCM tools in 2010.  IBM specifically upgraded WCM a lot just to make it a viable vendor in the marketplace.  It&#8217;s just that once it was released, the marketplace started asking for a lot more than just web content management.  Now the big three vendors are strong and have substantial R&amp;D dollars ready to plow into this space.  IBM bought core metrics and Unica as well.  Microsoft will doubtless evolve Sharepoint in it&#8217;s next major release in 2012 or 2013.  I suspect both of them will be able to show CXM functionality quite nicely soon.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a <a title="Seismic shift in portal market" href="http://blogs.perficient.com/digitaltransformation/2011/03/29/gartner-pcc-gartner-predicts-siesmic-shift-in-portal-market-by-2015/" target="_blank">previous post</a>, I talked about Gartners prediction of a &#8220;seismic shift&#8221; in the portal market.  In one of the last session of the Gartner Portal, Content &amp; Collaboration 2011 Summit, Gene Phifer spoke about the future of portals.  Gene is convinced that the portal market (and mashup market) will be &#8220;subsumed&#8221; by a new User Experience Platform market around 2015.  There are plenty of reasons to see these markets moving to this new UXP market:</p>
<ul>
<li>Organizations are demanding better user experiences in their portals.</li>
<li>They see consumerization driving other products and want it for their portals.</li>
<li>Mobile devices and the need for context-awareness are being demanded by users</li>
</ul>
<p>What about cloud-based portals &#8211; is that in our future?  It certainly is!   Many vendors are starting to offer cloud-based portal systems. But beware!  The very nature of the portal is that it typically connects to a whole bunch of other systems in your organization behind your firewall.  So for a cloud-based portal to be effective, you will need to open up your internal systems to the cloud vendor and have some serious networking pipes. On the other hand, a cloud-based portal would be ideal to integrate your other cloud-based applications.</p>
<p>2015 is still a long way away, so what is happening between now and that future?  Here are the seven things that Gartner sees trending in the portal market over the next few years.</p>
<ul>
<li>Analytics need to be implemented to help gauge the effectiveness of the portal.  There has been a recent flurry of acquisitions in the Web Analytics market by traditional and newer portal vendors</li>
<li>Portal-less Portals &#8211; there are several vendors beginning to offer portal type systems without claiming to be true portals.  Backbase is considered one of those vendors.  <a title="Adobe CQ5" href="http://blogs.perficient.com/digitaltransformation/2011/03/07/adobe-cq5-has-arrived/" target="_blank">Adobe&#8217;s CQ5</a> could also qualify.</li>
<li>Portal ubiquity &#8211; portals will become more ubiquitous as unbind their services</li>
<li>Exploit context across more user attributes (aka enhanced personalization)</li>
<li>Widgets are becoming more important and portlets less-so</li>
<li>Mobile is becoming a key first consideration</li>
<li>The User Experience Platform begins to emerge as a set of cohesive, pre-integrated, highly user interactive services rather than a bunch of products loosely coupled together.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, in terms of vendors, we have basically three major portal vendors today:  IBM, Oracle, and Microsoft.  Close behind are our open source friends Liferay and JBoss. As the market begins to move toward this UXP concept, we are going to see lots of other vendors emerge with UXP offerings.  Firms from the content management space are beginning to move toward UXP, as are firms in the Social Software, Mashups, Portal-less Portals and other Markets.</p>
<p>Here are some vendors to keep your eye on over the next few years:</p>
<p>IBM, Oracle, Microsoft, Liferay, Redhat JBoss, Backbase, Adobe, Cisco, Google, Apple, United Planet, JackBe, NetVibes, Pageflakes, Fatwire, Extron, Automony, Drupal, DotNetNuke, Plone, Jive, Atlassian, Telligent, SocialText.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So cloud has different meanings for different people. Not surprisingly, consumers have a different perspective than IT.</p>
<p>What is driving the cloud?  It&#8217;s all coming out of web 2.0.  Web 2.o continues to improve and mature.  Technology like REST and Ajax help it.  The user or community based paradigms get better.</p>
<h2>Portal and the Cloud</h2>
<ul>
<li>The portal is aggregation friendly. Good for the cloud.</li>
<li>It includes cloud capabilities.  Consuming web services is easy for them for example.</li>
<li>It embraces WOA/REST.  You see this in RESTful services, widget support, mashups, etc.</li>
<li>It supports MyPortal</li>
<li>Social Software functions are critical and integrating these things.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Vendor Cloud Offerings</h2>
<p>There are a number of major offerings by key vendors in the marketplace.</p>
<p><span id="more-394"></span></p>
<h3>Microsoft</h3>
<ul>
<li>Office Live</li>
<li>Windows Live</li>
<li>XBOX Live</li>
<li>Exchange Online</li>
<li>Sharepoint Online</li>
<li>Office Communications Online</li>
<li>Office Live Meeting</li>
<li>Windows Azure &#8211; just launched 5 weeks ago.</li>
<li>BPOS</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a lot of moving parts and a lot of pieces. It&#8217;s hard to put it all together.  With MSFT, you have low level services like Azure up to middle and top tiers like Sharepoint Online.  This is a very broad strategy.   You can deploy most of this on premises, have MSFT deploy them for you in a hosted model, and then have the actual shared model like BPOS.</p>
<h3>IBM</h3>
<p>IBM has a number of offerings.</p>
<ul>
<li>Web Conferencing in Lotus Live</li>
<li>Collaboration with Engage and connections</li>
<li>Amazon EC2 to spin up portal, content, etc.</li>
<li>He went through this really fast.  IBM offers a little more than he mentioned.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Google</h3>
<p>Google calls it GAPE or Google Apps Premier Edition.  They want to make money with this offering. It comes from the consumer side. They want to make people use the web more and thus use MSFT less and less. Google makes more money when people are online.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gmail and Google Calendar</li>
<li>Google Docs and Google Sites</li>
<li>Google Video</li>
<li>25 GB account for mail. 10 gb + 500 mb for storage</li>
<li>99.9% uptime guarantee</li>
</ul>
<p>Is it ready for prime time?  Gartner asks if the enterprise is ready for Google with it&#8217;s quick and nimble approach.  However, Google continues to enhance it&#8217;s product offerings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Postini acquisition for mail security and archive capability</li>
<li>Migration support</li>
<li>however, they had multiple outages last year.</li>
<li>Not a huge amount are taking the plunge.</li>
<li>iGoogle and Sites are out there. (Sites is the old Jotspot)</li>
<li>Google Wave is interesting.   It&#8217;s not integrated with existing products though.  Gartner considers it a good proof of concept</li>
</ul>
<h3>Covisint</h3>
<p>They are really one of the only ones who are pure play cloud.  They focus on a couple key industries.  They have horizontal offerings as well.</p>
<h3>Adobe</h3>
<p>Their key asset is their client site internet technologies like Flash, Flex, and PDF.  They are starting to offer cloud based services like acrobat and photoshop.com.  Jim Murphy sees them fleshing out collaboration and leveraging the analytics firm Omniture  to help the whole user experience.  (Note: Omniture isin my hometown of Orem Utah)</p>
<h2>Models in the cloud</h2>
<ol>
<li>Cloud Friendly: I consume cloud services</li>
<li>Cloud based portal as a service: Portal in the cloud either hosted or like BPOS from MSFT or LotusLive from IBM</li>
<li>Public Cloud Deployable: this is spin up portal on Amazon EC2</li>
<li>Private Cloud for internal use: Create your own private cloud and spin it up.</li>
<li>Private Cloud for external use: Same thing but different constituents.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Life Beyond the Titans</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s not just IBM and Microsoft</p>
<ul>
<li>Cisco is entering</li>
<li>Jive has been here a while</li>
<li>Oracle has some offerings</li>
<li>Force.com</li>
<li>Amazon</li>
<li>AT&amp;T</li>
<li>Yahoo!</li>
<li>Facebook</li>
<li>and a bunch more</li>
</ul>
