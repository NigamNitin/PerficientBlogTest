				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bertrand de Coatpont and Scott Date of Adobe about online communities.  This is communities within Experience Manager. Specifically, it&#8217;s version 6.1 which has completely redone Communities.</p>
<p><a href="/adobe-blog/files/2015/02/hand_writing_strategy_shutterstock_wordpress.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-662" src="/adobe-blog/files/2015/02/hand_writing_strategy_shutterstock_wordpress-300x211.jpg" alt="hand_writing_strategy_shutterstock_wordpress" width="300" height="211" srcset="/adobe-blog/files/2015/02/hand_writing_strategy_shutterstock_wordpress-300x211.jpg 300w, /adobe-blog/files/2015/02/hand_writing_strategy_shutterstock_wordpress-600x421.jpg 600w, /adobe-blog/files/2015/02/hand_writing_strategy_shutterstock_wordpress.jpg 651w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>There&#8217;s a thought that a community project is an overwhelming effort from a time and engineering perspective.   With that in mind, Adobe has made a lot of simplifications.</p>
<p>Who uses the site:<span id="more-913"></span></p>
<p>Builders</p>
<ul>
<li>Community administrators</li>
<li>Content and brand managers</li>
</ul>
<p>Members</p>
<ul>
<li>Community Manager &#8211; not a company employee but is a trusted individual</li>
<li>Community members &#8211; those who have joined the site and participate in the communities. (likes, voting, article creation, commenting</li>
<li>Community User &#8211; a simple viewer of the content</li>
</ul>
<h3>Let&#8217;s Build a Community Site</h3>
<p>Pain Point: I need something now and I need it to be simple. A business user should be able to do this.</p>
<p>They showed a live demo of the new Communities. It will be released on May 7th.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rebecca is a community administrator
<ul>
<li>She already has a couple communities up and running but needs a new one</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The new version has the revised UI which matches the themes from Marketing Cloud</li>
<li>In administration page of the new UI
<ul>
<li>Each community has a set of building blocks called community functions
<ul>
<li>Activity Stream</li>
<li>Forum</li>
<li>Group</li>
<li>Page</li>
<li>Assignments</li>
<li>File Library</li>
<li>each is a normal AEM component but already wired together for community context</li>
<li>Blogs and calendars are coming soon</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>AEM provides a number of reference site templates you can use or choose to make your own
<ul>
<li>These templates have a structure tab that shows what functions are used in that template</li>
<li>You can add additional functions to any communities via a drag and drop interface</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The concept of group is a place where community members can have sub-communities
<ul>
<li>Still uses the same building blocks</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is a new wizard to create a community site
<ul>
<li>Press a create site button</li>
<li>Fill in key information like Title, description, community name, and default template</li>
<li>Choose which design you want. This is the theme, color, etc.
<ul>
<li>based on twitter bootstrap so that&#8217;s where the default themes are derived</li>
<li>It&#8217;s fully responsive</li>
<li>Can add your own branding</li>
<li>Can configure basic things like a header image</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Define options like
<ul>
<li>allow self registration</li>
<li>allow anonymous access</li>
<li>allow private messaging</li>
<li>allow social logins like Facebook or Twitter</li>
<li>other settings include
<ul>
<li>Tags for the community</li>
<li>Moderation
<ul>
<li>Is it moderated</li>
<li>flagging threshold</li>
<li>definition of community moderators (admins or members)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Group Management
<ul>
<li>Can create sub-groups, admins for those groups, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Translation
<ul>
<li>Define default language</li>
<li>Check a box to allow machine translation into multiple languages</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>hit the finish button and you get a new site</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Created the site but then went to another existing community that had more content</li>
<li>Reporting: Not in this release. It&#8217;s coming shortly after</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Second pain point</strong>: I don&#8217;t want a rigid community. Make it easy to administer</p>
<p>Back to the demo but from a content manager standpoint</p>
<ul>
<li>Login gives a number of options like sites, moderation of site, users, etc.</li>
<li>As a content manager, the manager has flexibility to put features on different pages and parts of pages.</li>
<li>Uses the same layout tools from AEM Web Content Management
<ul>
<li>Add an image</li>
<li>add a community function</li>
<li>Preview in responsive scenarios</li>
<li>resizing of images</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can also do targeting and personalization within the community</li>
</ul>
<p>Now switch to the community manager (non-employees who help to manage the site)</p>
<p>This is a manage groups and moderate content scenario</p>
<ul>
<li>From the web site (community is a sub-site)
<ul>
<li>Community manager can login and see the community manager options</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The UI lets you do moderation for each piece of content in context (e.g. no admin screen, just embedded in the normal page)
<ul>
<li>Reply, Flag, Delete, Edit, Deny</li>
<li>Flag puts it in a workflow</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Does have access to the administration link
<ul>
<li>This includes bulk administration option</li>
<li>Find all flagged content</li>
<li>approve any content</li>
<li>deny or delete the content</li>
<li>Search can be for status of content (pending , approved, denied, closed)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As a group manager, the user accesses and manages the group(s)
<ul>
<li>Can add a new group to the community site</li>
<li>Invite users
<ul>
<li>Use a type ahead to find users</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make the group public or private</li>
<li>Choose a group template</li>
<li>add an image</li>
<li>Post has a rich text editor embedded
<ul>
<li>can also attach images or files</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pain Point</strong>: Has to have a rich community experience. More than just a forum.</p>
<ul>
<li>Members can see private messages in their inbox (assuming it&#8217;s allowed)</li>
<li>The activity stream lets you see what&#8217;s happening in all the community functions.
<ul>
<li>Has a following concept within the community
<ul>
<li>follow users and pages</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Activity stream only shows activities for people / content you follow. Content includes threads</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can update your personal profile</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fifth Persona: Community Users</strong></p>
<p>Pain Point: find it online and make it available via multiple devices</p>
<ul>
<li>By default, this user is not logged in.</li>
<li>The pages use a nice structure to allow it to be easily indexed
<ul>
<li>Google can thus find the public content</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>has an internal search as well</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So as you can see, each user type has a robust set of functionality available to them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the first year where travel and hospitality is a core and strategic vertical.</p>
<p>Stats:</p>
<ol>
<li>50% of your customers start their travel journey with no brand in mind</li>
<li>100% of your customers expect a to be remembered by their airline or hotel</li>
</ol>
<p>This is about &#8220;marketing&#8221; beyond marketing. In other words, support the entire experience, not just a lead.  If you have a flow that includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dreaming</li>
<li>Research</li>
<li>Booking</li>
<li>Prepare</li>
<li>Experience</li>
<li>Loyalty</li>
</ul>
<p>Then you should treat them like you know them throughout that cycle.<span id="more-892"></span></p>
<p><strong>Quote</strong>: In general, our biggest issues would be the every rising customer expectations driven by technology. (Best Western CEO David Kong)</p>
<p>Three themes:</p>
<ol>
<li>To win the future, you need to optimize convenience.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s about mobility&#8230;&#8230;. not just mobile. You need to evaluate your mobile platform at the user level</li>
<li>Marketing and technology teams need to be connected.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Julie Hoffman &#8211; MGM Interview</h3>
<p>Julie is a Senior Executive Director at MGM.  MGM is an <strong>Entertainment</strong> company.  They are NOT a technology company.  Memory is important but it takes amplification and frequency to move from short term to long term memory.   Correlate this to MGM&#8217;s goal to build great experiences.  MGM co-creates in their customers experience.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: How does convenience play into the customer journey</p>
<p>Time is the ultimate short commodity.  You only have so much of it. You cannot afford to waste their time on the phone choosing options. The burden does not belong to the customer.  MGM wants to take the burden back.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> How has MGM done their transformation</p>
<p>Started with a customer experience committee. We formed a vision and a strategy.  That led to alignment by organization with a Chief Experience Officer and a continuing journey</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: What is the one thing Marketers in this industry need to do?</p>
<p>Realize that there is a whole community there to help.  This is cross-industry. Lots of people are willing to help.</p>
<h3>Future Vision in Technology</h3>
<p>Showed a video on a completely integrated experience</p>
<ul>
<li>Checkin</li>
<li>See your friends who are also in town</li>
<li>order room service from your phone</li>
<li>Your phone is key</li>
<li>Housekeeping users their app to see your preferences and whether you are in your room</li>
<li>Extend your stay and book a concert</li>
<li>Visit the spa with points</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>This was all created using a storyscape approach that combines brand strategy, product placement, customer experience, to create the journey.</p>
<p>He showed a travel experience cloud. It&#8217;s a dense slide put into key streams:</p>
<ol>
<li>Analytics</li>
<li>traveler touchpoints</li>
<li>platofmr services</li>
<li>relationship management services (media buy, booking, pricing, etc)</li>
<li>Core systems</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a nice way to combine all the pieces and parts.</p>
<p><strong>Stats</strong>: 95% want to deliver a great customer experience. 80% say they deliver a superior experience.  <strong>Only 8%</strong> of customers feel they receive a customer experience.  (Closing the delivery gap study by Bain)</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot of room for improvement.</p>
<p><strong>From &#8212; To</strong></p>
<p>Channels and Platforms to Experiences</p>
<p>Silo-ed moments to ongoing journey</p>
<p>Bookings to Trips</p>
<p>Messaging to Engagement</p>
<p>Isolated Scores to Holistic Measurement</p>
<p>Employees to Heroes</p>
<p>Travelers to People</p>
<h3>Chad Westfall of IHG : Reinventing Digital Content Delivery</h3>
<p>Chad shared a personal experience.   He was speaking at a Marketing Symposium and had a taxi experience where the cab driver had to use a really large map book just to find his destination&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; all while the meter was ticking.  Chad contrasted this with Uber and the connected experience.  Chad felt very uncomfortable in this disconnected world.</p>
<p>In 2014, IHG&#8217;s digital channel surpassed $5 billion in sales.  That&#8217;s 20% of overall sales. 360 million visits to the website.</p>
<p>IHG&#8217;s Challenge: not giving a rich experience to their customers.</p>
<p>They have to do it in 16 languages, 200 countries, a heavy stack that hampers ability to make change.  On top of that, page delivery performance was abysmal.</p>
<p><strong>Reinvention</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>system architecture
<ol>
<li>realized they needed to completely separate commerce from content</li>
<li>Decoupled the system, modularized the code, and enabled new delivery systems outside of the commerce component</li>
<li>Deployment: used akamai to cache the content</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>how we interact with systems
<ol>
<li>AEM</li>
<li>Business creates content</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>localization process
<ol>
<li>Brought in Smartling as a translation partner.  This tool had to support unified translation memory and supported automation of translation</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>global delivery model
<ol>
<li>akamai caching</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Results:</p>
<ul>
<li>65% reducstion in delivery time</li>
<li>75% reduction in language rollout</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Hotel Experience</span></p>
<p>IHG just stared an implementation of Adobe Audience Manger to create that experience in the hotel. It&#8217;s just the start of the journey.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today at Adobe Summit, Urosh Pajic and Peter Krmpotic of Adobe spoke about best practices in content optimization with Adobe Experience Manager.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Remember the time when it was enough to just put your content out there and gain customer attention? These times are long gone, and today’s customers expect personalized and relevant content across all touchpoints. To amaze customers and gain their loyalty, marketers need multiple content optimization point products that work seamlessly together out of the box. Along with cross-channel content analytics, every modern digital strategy needs real-time customer segmentation as well as actionable content insights and the ability to deliver dynamic creative content at scale. This session provides tips on how to pair Adobe Experience Manager best-in-class experience delivery with industry-leading content personalization and optimization tools.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">They started out with the idea that not all interaction are the same. Those interaction that build trust and fulfill your needs are the ones that will make an impact.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Key Goal:</strong> Become an organization your customers trust</p>
<p class="p1">Key Takeaways</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Shorten the cycle for iterations</li>
<li class="p1">Close the feedback loop</li>
<li class="p1">Empower people with great technology</li>
</ol>
<h3>Personalization</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s now a necessity.  you don&#8217;t want to serve the Seahawks jersey to the Patriots fan.</p>
<p>Many today look like this:<span id="more-881"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Slow time to market for personalization</li>
<li>Disparate teams owning content authoring, delivery and personalization</li>
</ul>
<p>What you need</p>
<ol>
<li>Deliver relevant content</li>
<li>Streamline cooperation between content authoring and delivery</li>
<li>Leverages personalization capabilities when authoring content</li>
</ol>
<p>Demo:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start with the Adobe Marketing Cloud screen. Yes, it&#8217;s not AEM but highlights the ever increasing integration of the entire Marketing Cloud
<ul>
<li>Includes an add button for additional services like analytics and Test / Target</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Showed the admin interface (similar interface styles for all Marketing Cloud)</li>
<li>Found a site to edit and go to a specific page to edit.</li>
<li>Note: All functionality lies within AEM</li>
<li>Changed from edit to targeting mode
<ul>
<li>Changed the options in the top bar of the page</li>
<li>Created an activity (way to create several experiences across pages)</li>
<li>select a component to test by clicking on that section of the page.</li>
<li>Chose a few experiences.  (e.g. A/B)
<ul>
<li>an offer is an html fragment you will put in the personalized area</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New feature in AEM 6.1 &#8211; the offer library. Makes it easier to store all your offers.</li>
<li>Approve the content and voila, experience B is ready</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>He repeated by creating an experience C using the same set of tasks.</li>
<li>Hit step two in the activity: Diagram the activity
<ul>
<li>This is the step where you map all your segments to the experiences</li>
<li>This could be segments from profiles and audiences or from Adobe Target</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Step three is the settings like start date, duration, etc.
<ul>
<li>This is the final step</li>
</ul>
</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The theme is reinvention. Michael has reinvented himself many times. Starting with standup then on to comedy then on to more serious roles.  Then&#8230;&#8230;.. he was Batman.</p>
<p>A recap of today&#8217;s Adobe Summit interview:</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Did you steer your career or did you go with the flow?</p>
<p>I started something in college then dropped out. I had to start acting in comedy after I dropped out to get back to college.  I tried comedy at a Jazz club.  When I went to California the goal was to seek employment. In retrospect, standup comedy was really good for me.  I had a ton of interest but I needed a focus. Once I started to actually work in film, I focused and made a couple decisions early on to setup a career that I hoped that would be to my advantage.  It was doing as many things as you can.</p>
<p>There was never a master plan. There were strategic moves and a type of discipline that worked.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Let&#8217;s talk about Birdman. Congrats on the Oscar and Golden Globe.  A lot of people were surprised and sad that you didn&#8217;t win the Oscar for best actor? Why do you think you didn&#8217;t win?<span id="more-869"></span></p>
<p>uuhhhhhhhh&#8230;&#8230;.  The whole campaign for best actor was an interesting experience.  I had a good attitude about going in given all the previous wins. I like to be a competitor. But the point is that it was out of my control.  Michael wanted to do something to bring it back into control. (Play a game of one-on-one basketball)</p>
<p>Why I didn&#8217;t win: I don&#8217;t know but I will tell you that you need to think that you will win.  In this case, these awards don&#8217;t measure the degree of difficulty required for what was accomplished.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: A lot of folks are tech folks here.  You&#8217;ve done a lot of special effects, animation, etc. Do you think technology is helping or hurting films?</p>
<p>In the long run it&#8217;s helping. You can make films like Multiplicity so much faster and easier with technology.  It can be a challenge to play into green screens even though it opens up possibilities.</p>
<p>Take Beetlejuice.  If you were to make it again, you would run the risk of too much technology.  It&#8217;s so much more efficient now though.  It can add to the democratization of film making.</p>
<p>A lot of people can make films now. There is more opportunity for people to express themselves.  I always thought people would make a pretty good movie on their phone.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> What do you talk about in social?</p>
<p>I believe it&#8217;s an unbelievable tool in twitter.  I don&#8217;t tweet a lot.  I was fishing in the bahamas.  I asked my friend what he was doing and he replied, &#8220;I&#8217;m tweeting&#8221;  His friend showed the fisherman how twitter worked and helped the guy build his business as they relayed good places to fish, where they were, etc.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s less about what I ate for lunch.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> One of the way Marketing has changed is from the number of awards and then measuring yourself at the end of a campaign.  How do you measure your success?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not about the measurement of monetary wealth. For me it&#8217;s about professionally, how good can I get at what I want to be?</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> What&#8217;s your &#8220;place?&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s Montana. I feel the most at home there.  I love the outside. The West always held a fascination. I took a trip to the west and I was done. I love the space and the entire feel.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My notes from an interview with Nate Silver, founder of  FiveThirtyEight.com, at Adobe Summit:</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> When did you say you could have a profession in number and stats?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know when really but I took a boring consulting job right out of college.  In my spare time I started working on a program to forecast how baseball players would do.  I think KPMG technically owns everything I do still. (audience laugh after pregnant pause&#8230;..)</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: (roll Charles Barclay video on his anti-analytics riff)  What do say to that riff?</p>
<p>Charles is a really smart guy actually but it&#8217;s pretty much total BS what he said.  Houston Rockets are run by an MIT grad. The spurs are analytics driven. The best teams in the NBA use analytics.  We can now measure how good or lazy people are on defense.  (How far someone runs during a game is the stat)</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Let&#8217;s talk baseball. Is there a difference between how teams use data or is it the new norm?</p>
<p>There is an aspect of adverse selection for the teams that don&#8217;t use analytics.  It&#8217;s gone from an open source kind of thing to being behind closed doors. (kind of a shame really)  All but two or three teams list an analyst in the front office.<span id="more-871"></span></p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Is the NBA harder or is the data set different than baseball?</p>
<p>Baseball is a weird sport because people take their turn.  When modeling interactions between players like in the NBA things become more challenging. There is pretty good data though. The NBA is at the peak of growth for this now.  In the sports analytics world basketball is the most exciting?</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> What about soccer?</p>
<p>There is huge money in soccer.  Munich is doing analytics. Others are throwing millions at players.  Soccer is seeing a lot of growth. They used to only keep track of goals and red cards. But now they are looking at a lot more in crosses, touches, tackles, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Another area where you came to the fore is politics.  What is the difference with politics?</p>
<p>I think politics is different for a lot of reasons. You don&#8217;t have the competition you have in sports.  Politics is about how the media talks about it.  If you actually look at polls, the public is a lot more chill than the media.  They focus on pretty basic stuff. The media will accentuate the outliers.  An Obama poll showing him winning in Utah would get all the media attention.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> What were the polls missing?</p>
<p>The polls were fine. The people couldn&#8217;t read the polls correctly. When you have so much data like you have now, it&#8217;s hard to read.  The majority of polls showed Obama in the lead in the last month.  It was a pretty basic thing. Look at polls in swing states, take an average and you saw the result.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: How do you see this shaping up?</p>
<p>One of the things about prediction is that you can make a decent prediction in the short term but it becomes a lot more fuzzy the further out you predict.  All the indicators show a really close election in 2016.  To a first approximation it&#8217;s close. Hillary seems reasonably safe in a Democratic primary.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: You are also an entrepreneur. One thing you have to do is how to communicate the data.  How do you and your colleagues do that?</p>
<p>The first part of it is to understand the question. We are trying to avoid putting three unrelated items together.  We are doing basic techniques and then communicate it.  If you can&#8217;t communicate the method then you missed.  He used an example of an academic paper with bad writing that can obscure brilliant insights.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> So, if you don&#8217;t know your data then you should be a poor writer?</p>
<p>We want our writers to know their subject and data really well. We try to reverse the shouting and screaming when people don&#8217;t know their topic.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: What can people take away from your approach?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s about asking the right questions. We use some Adobe products to understand how our site is performing. We may not be using the right measure.  We want to measure according to business objectives to get out of the short term.  It used to be we had really great way to measure offense but really poor ways of measuring defense. Billy Bean&#8217;s teams started with poor defense.  As he measured better, his teams defense got a lot better.</p>
<p>This stuff takes time vs a quick fix.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Highlights from Adobe Summit&#8217;s Day 2 session with Steve Young and Collin Resch:</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> If you were still playing, would you throw to Richard Sherman?</p>
<p>In college, everyone was open. In the pros, no one was open.  To me, I don&#8217;t care who is out there. If you are open, you are getting the football. If you are covered, probably not.  Part of performing is finding out how good you are.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Did you cringe at throwing to one side of the field?</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t want to give into that.  You don&#8217;t want to avoid competition.  It feels kind of creepy.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Analytics and predictions goes hand in hand with this.  You have a different mindset.<span id="more-867"></span></p>
<p>I met with this company called predictive DNA. He said by DNA he could figure out if you would be a good athlete or not. I hated that. Think of what it would mean to a 10 year old Steve Young.  Pretty soon, we are a bunch of mice in a wheel.</p>
<p>I know it&#8217;s useful. I do like predictive technology. I just don&#8217;t want to be trapped by it.</p>
<p><strong>Point:</strong> You invented yourself even in high school. You threw a no-hitter in baseball actually.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t drink and I threw that the day after senior prom so take that in context&#8230;&#8230;.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> You are known as a running quarterback.  You go to BYU, a throwing team.  You reinvent yourself. You take a round about way to the NFL. You then hit San Francisco with a key emphasis on accuracy. Obviously you know how to reinvent yourself.</p>
<p>I learned how to throw the football when I was in college.  Then I learned how to be accurate. But in the pros, you have to open up your visibility.  I learned quickly that I wasn&#8217;t very tall compared to other quarterbacks.   Key quote: You better start seeing the open guy.  The job demands 6&#8242; 5&#8243;. So what do you do?  Wear high heels?  I finally realized that I know where Jerry is going so throw it where you think Jerry Rice is.  I started to throw the ball blind.  Jerry started to catch the ball.</p>
<p>Jerry&#8217;s advice: Steve, just put it in my chest.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: What are the searing memories of your career?</p>
<p>Throwing the ball blind.  When he catches it then I can say, &#8220;I&#8217;m taller&#8221;  Steve gave an example of throwing the ball blind and getting dog piled. Hearing the crowd go silent he knew that Jerry Rice caught it.  That was a great moment.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t reinvent yourself. You just figure out other ways to deliver.  Figure out other ways to be agile and responsive. There&#8217;s nothing that makes you old than not knowing what&#8217;s happening in technology. I buy that new thing.  I don&#8217;t want to hear that this is a 20 something generation.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: As CEO of a global capital firm you said, &#8220;I want to know as a private equity guy who use to play ball.&#8221;  Why?</p>
<p>I got my law degree while winning three Super Bowls. The teachers didn&#8217;t care.  My dad said to prepare for your next life.  In the NFL it&#8217;s over at 38.  I just humbled myself and go back to school so I can be good at something after the NFL.  I never knew there were so many common denominators between sports and business.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not buying a company, I&#8217;m buying them. Invest in someone. Trust them.  It&#8217;s a different world with no clock and no score but it&#8217;s still a great ride.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Let&#8217;s talk about the final play and Nate Silver and stats.  You listen to all these stats and the final play of the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>This is what&#8217;s wrong with data. Numbers never lie but they never tell the whole truth either.  There are zero percent of throws from the 1/2 yard line inside of the tackle box.  You have to be careful. Everything is contextual.</p>
<p><strong>Quote</strong>: You have to royally screw up on multiple levels to lose.</p>
<p><strong>Quote</strong>: If the ultimate guy is not accountable then that&#8217;s a bad thing.</p>

<li>Customer and Attributes within <strong>Profiles and Audiences</strong> let you import data from any external source. You can create fields, modify them, delete them, etc.</li>
<li>Predictive analytics
<ul>
<li>Starwood saw a spike in a luxury property in Arizona</li>
<li><strong>Adobe analytics</strong> detected the anomaly (booking spike).  Bookings were happening via a hotel feature page.</li>
<li><strong>Contribution analysis</strong> does regression analysis to figure out what is causing the anomaly.
<ul>
<li>In this case, a golf cart video pushed people to the bookings page</li>
<li>It also identified the customer data attributes specific to who is buying and which can be used for future purposes</li>
<li>e.g., Adobe says you are all now data scientists.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>But where is the action coming from this insight?
<ul>
<li>first, those insights become different user segments based on that regression analysis</li>
<li>Turn that segment into an audience within the Marketing Cloud</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The audience is now available to the marketing cloud and therefore, to the <strong>media optimizer</strong>
<ul>
<li>Can create a Phoenician Golf Retargeting campaign.</li>
<li>Knowing the audience, you can up the available $$ per prospect</li>
<li><strong>Audience manager</strong> can analyze the initial prospects segment and find people who look just like them, thus increasing the number of users for the campaign.
<ul>
<li>e.g. take the audience from 42K to 400K</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Created the campaign via the shared <strong>assets manager</strong></li>
<li>Then pushed to <strong>Adobe Campaign</strong> to view and manage the campaign.
<ul>
<li>Note: the UI is much improved from what it was a year ago.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The retargeting workflow includes a combination of this audience segment just created elsewhere and then setup the workflow and rules on where and how to interact with the end users.
<ul>
<li>The campaign uses <strong>Adobe Assets</strong> to grab golf specific media.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Guest engagement
<ul>
<li>Mobile guests are welcomed with a message on their phone</li>
<li>Includes the check in and the use of the phone as the room key</li>
<li>Offers are now set to be delivered while on property</li>
<li><strong>Adobe Experience Manager</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is another highlight of comprehensive, integrated, and actionable</p>
<h3>Interview: Chris Nortion, Vice President CRM Starwood Hotels and Resorts</h3>
<p><strong>What do you think about the demo?</strong></p>
<p>Love the power of the Adobe Marketing Cloud. You can&#8217;t create that experience by picking off point solutions.  Reached the point where this common integration is key</p>
<p>Digital innovation is in Starwoods blood.  Use a small but highly set of cross-matrixed teams.  Bring them all in during ideation phase.  All these teams, including legal and privacy officers help keep it real but opens everyone up to the art of the possible.</p>
<p>The delta and uber projects helps Starwood help manager the relation from flight to transport to hotel.</p>
<p>The internet of things is fascinating. They have a cool pilot at the Phoenician using in room tablets to drive marketing into the room. It&#8217;s more than just offer based marketing.</p>
<ol>
<li>lighting</li>
<li>temperature</li>
<li>in room dining</li>
<li>i-beacons in the hotel.
<ol>
<li>As you approach the front desk and can be greeted by name and be more proactive</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>How do you measure?</strong></p>
<p>This is a key passion for Chris. Try not to hold too many sacred cows. Willing to dump projects that don&#8217;t work.  There&#8217;s a lot of debate about analytics but it helps to have a positive track record</p>
<p><strong>Tell me about the innovation center Star Lab</strong></p>
<p>Bringing a design led approach so they can innovate at a very fast pace.  it&#8217;s more than just a bunch of cool office cubicles and space.  It&#8217;s about projects like SPG keyless.  The Apple watch app for this was part of the innovation.  Open the door with the watch.</p>
<p>Just watched a pro-meetings app to allow meetings planner to control the room.  Let&#8217;s planners have more control of the surrounding and collaboration with the SPG team.</p>
