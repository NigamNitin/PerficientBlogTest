				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dr. Tal  Schwartz of Clicktale and Arran Peck  from Ancestry.com discussed how they transformed their experience. He started with a video.</p>
<p>The Clicktale product pulls all the information about everything someone does on the site.  It&#8217;s an easy integration to the web site.  They also integrate to Adobe Analystics, Adobe Target, and Adobe Experience Manager. By getting these deep insights, you can use that to create better tests and more efficiently optimize your site.<img class="size-full wp-image-3216 alignleft" src="/adobe-blog/files/2016/03/clicktale-heat-map.jpeg" alt="clicktale-heat-map" width="253" height="199" /></p>
<p>AEM Integration</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a button on AEM site and you get a heat map to show you what users are doing on the site.</p>
<p>Many companies like CNN and Ancestry.com are using Clicktale</p>
<p>Mobile vs desktop: There are a number of use cases suited to mobile vs desktop.  In other words both have their place. Neither is going away.  That&#8217;s why Clicktale supports both channels.  You can get full session playback for a mobile site.  You also get a heat map for the mobile page.</p>
<h2>Ancestry&#8217;s Usage</h2>
<p>Arran has been with Ancestry.com for quite a while.  He ran the Australia office for a while but recently moved to the Bay Area.  He&#8217;s the senior director of conversion.<span id="more-3215"></span></p>
<p>Ancestry</p>
<ul>
<li>leading online family history service</li>
<li>Subscription allows you to access voer 2B document</li>
<li>leading DNA test for family history
<ul>
<li>Genotyped 1.5 M customers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>$680M revenue in 2015</li>
<li>1,300 employees</li>
<li>Offices in US, UK, Australia, Canada, and Sweden</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Conversion and Insights, a love story</strong></h3>
<p>A lot of Ancestry&#8217;s brand is about storytelling.  The story</p>
<ul>
<li>Uses Adobe Analytics to get data insights and see what opportunities exist</li>
<li>Create the hypothesis and then test it in Adobe Target</li>
<li>Use Tableau dashboards to see the data in Target and the actual revenue.
<ul>
<li>Business impact</li>
<li>Lifetime revenue</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>But were missing the customer insight.  Over 80% of the time, people were doing unexpected things.
<ul>
<li>Wanted to know why a test won and why a test lost</li>
<li>It&#8217;s about that true insight in actual usage</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Case Study 1</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3217" src="/adobe-blog/files/2016/03/ancestrydna-600x225.png" alt="ancestrydna" width="600" height="225" srcset="/adobe-blog/files/2016/03/ancestrydna-600x225.png 600w, /adobe-blog/files/2016/03/ancestrydna-300x112.png 300w, /adobe-blog/files/2016/03/ancestrydna-768x288.png 768w, /adobe-blog/files/2016/03/ancestrydna.png 1297w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Ancestry DNA is a simple $99 test to find your ethnic mix and uncover distant relatives.  This gives</p>
<ul>
<li>New audience</li>
<li>Significant increase in traffic to home page</li>
<li>But limited insight into customer behavior</li>
</ul>
<p>Ran a test on the Ancestry DNA page.  They wanted to find out about the impact to different sections.  The results were good with an overall increase in sales.  However, ClickTale showed that all the middle content had little engagement.  The bottom section for FAQ&#8217;s had 53 seconds, almost 3X the other sections.</p>
<p>Then changed the banner image from white male to Native American</p>
<h3>Case Study 2</h3>
<p>Iterative testing into a great experience.   This test was about onboarding.  They used a testing process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Think it</li>
<li>Test it</li>
<li>Build it</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=" wp-image-3218 alignleft" src="/adobe-blog/files/2016/03/ancestryfamilytree-529x600.png" alt="ancestryfamilytree" width="327" height="370" srcset="/adobe-blog/files/2016/03/ancestryfamilytree-529x600.png 529w, /adobe-blog/files/2016/03/ancestryfamilytree-265x300.png 265w, /adobe-blog/files/2016/03/ancestryfamilytree-300x340.png 300w, /adobe-blog/files/2016/03/ancestryfamilytree.png 584w" sizes="(max-width: 327px) 100vw, 327px" />So new functionality gets tested before rollout of functionality.   In this case, they wanted to make it really easy to run through your family tree.</p>
<p>Outcome:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase bill through of customers in free stage trial</li>
<li>Users more likely to bill through after the trial if they actually build their family tree</li>
<li>Quicker speed to discovery and to building a full product for A/B test validation (get product to release quicker)</li>
</ul>
<p>The process</p>
<ol>
<li>Setup four rounds of the experience</li>
<li>Look at the Clicktale videos</li>
<li>Build second prototype and test again
<ol>
<li>Also looked at if users were building trees quicker, etc.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>He showed how they were able to see the test results</li>
</ol>
<h3>Happy Customer, Happy Life</h3>
<p>The voice of the customer amplified</p>
<p>The team with members who spent a minimum of two hours every six weeks watching what a customer does on the site saw far greater improvements to their designs&#8217; user experience.</p>
<p>With Clicktale, can view videos by interest (</p>
<ul>
<li>Customer device
<ul>
<li>destktop</li>
<li>tablet</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>customer profile
<ul>
<li>customer type</li>
<li>product purchased</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>entry page</li>
<li>Specific Tests</li>
<li>Specific page visite</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Quote:</strong> Combining conversion testing with the videos creates a better customer experience and happier results.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Abbie Wombach holds the FIFA record for the most international goals among men and women soccer players. She&#8217;s also a two time Olympic Gold Medalist</p>
<p>Question: Since you retired you&#8217;ve been doing cool things</p>
<p>Answer: I&#8217;ve been pretty busy.  I traveled around the world talking to FIFA and CEO&#8217;s  I want to change the world.  There&#8217;s a need to positively impact your environment.  Get equal opportunity for everyone.  Let&#8217;s focus on more than a niche. Everyone deserves a shot to be treated equally</p>
<p>Question: You are an inspiration to millions worldwide.  The key is the inequality to the gap in pay.  That includes in soccer.  This gap and how people think about it.</p>
<p>Answer: 10-15 years ago the conversation would have been different with the recent comments of ??. Hr resigned today but that wouldn&#8217;t have happened   It means</p>
<p>Question: You won the world cup and made $2M for the team. Germany won last year and came back with $35M.<span id="more-3205"></span></p>
<p>Answer: Look at the data.  We had more viewership than any other event so it needs to be resolved.</p>
<p>Question: You have such a great brand as the womens team.</p>
<p>Answer: It gives me chills to see that happen. It&#8217;s great to see men, especially professional players to give that respect. It&#8217;s been a long time that it&#8217;s been earned.  We work to gain respect.</p>
<p>Question: You went to the Whitehouse and what did he call you</p>
<p>Answer: uh, he called me the greatest of all time</p>
<p>Question: you were the youngest of 7 kids. Was eating with a huge family ever a problem</p>
<p>Answer: Yeah, I eat too quickly because I had to compete for the food. You can see why I was able to build the body I was able to build.  Be proud of your body women. Having a huge family was really impactful.  Coming from somewhere is important. Those are the things that propel you. they are the dynamite in your shoes.  Use your past as a positive to push you forward.</p>
<p>Question: Adobe Summit, the theme is about experience. Your life is one experience after another.  You&#8217;ve had this amazing career which culminated in what most would make you the greatest women&#8217;s soccer player of all time. What&#8217; stands out.</p>
<p>Answer: loaded question.   It was winning the medals but more importantly it was the locker room after.  There&#8217;s nothing better than that. Then comes seeing your family after that.  The process is more important than the outcome. I like to stay in the present and enjoy the process. Let the outcome happen by the hard work you put into the process.   Yes, my next role in life will be bigger than my first.</p>
<p>Question: roll a video of a girl inspired by Abbie.  (the interviewer&#8217;s video of his two year old)  Do you stop and think about the reach you now have?</p>
<p>Answer: No, not really. My source of what I do is internal. The whole goal is to have a purpose internally.  My authenticity is my saving grace in life.  Love me or hate me I don&#8217;t really care.</p>
<p>Question: I had a conversation with your friend Julie Fowdy.  She&#8217;s so enthusiastic.  She&#8217;s taking herself and bringing herself down just a notch.</p>
<p>Answer: It takes a plan and putting the talk into action.   There are massive issues that have to be tackled.  Someone has to stand up and do the work. I&#8217;m ready for it.</p>
<p>Question: would you ever go into broadcasting?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, I just signed a deal with ESPN. It should be fun. I&#8217;m kind of in a year of saying yes.  I have to figure out what I like and don&#8217;t like.</p>
<p>Question: Working out isn&#8217;t a priority. What sport?</p>
<p>Answer: Golf. It&#8217;s a competition with yourself.</p>
<p>End: do something with a soccer ball.  Lots of headers.</p>
<h2>Cirque Du Soleil, Alma Derrick VP</h2>
<p>Question: you did something a lot of kids dream of. You ran away to the circus</p>
<p>Answer; The circus finds you. I was hooked a kids. Cirque is now 30 years old. We are undergoing a new transformation.  We are now owned by TPG.  It&#8217;s a chance to ask all the questions. From a business side, everything is back on the table.  Our brand is incredible on the stage.  But beyond that we are challenged.</p>
<p>Question: Let&#8217;s talk about experience.  Your product is experience.  How do you think about experience?</p>
<p>Answer: Our product doesn&#8217;t translate to any other media. It&#8217;s just not the same on TV.  I think we are in the right place with that.  We are challenged in selling the concept of the show itself.  The most radical thing we can do is to be more intimate.</p>
<p>Question: you are exposing the inside or the inner workings.</p>
<p>Answer: Exactly.  They want to  know more about our performers and behind the scenes.   it&#8217;s about turning the volume down and telling stories in a way that&#8217;s really different for us.</p>
<p>Question: Consumer expectations continue to rise.  But you are here to promote that with the next show. Does that work against you?</p>
<p>Answer: Not on stage.  Once we get people into the stage. But we certainly are expected to not do anything that&#8217;s normal.  Some things we do in marketing are not spectacular though.</p>
<p>Question: you do have an incredible brand.  Recently you&#8217;ve started to stretch the brand.</p>
<p>Answer: one of the things with intimacy. How do you break the show into it&#8217;s component parts.  We have set designers, dancers, set designers etc.  Cirque shops are the first step. The first was around dance.   The idea came from one of our dancers in Beetles Loved.  She brought a lot of insights to the table.  There are 75 dance studios. There&#8217;s space for us to do these master classes for a half-day.  It&#8217;s a different way to experience it.</p>
<p>Question: let&#8217;s talk about teams.  How does Cirque thing about themes</p>
<p>Answer: One of the most interesting things I learned at Cirque.  In the traditional circus. The trapeze artists are all one family.  They would build the set and strap everyone in.   What Cirque did is to bring technology and rigor.  The rigor is now an engineer.  Trust is more than just the family now.</p>
<p>Question: You take corporate teams in Spark session to learn about this team work.</p>
<p>Answer: We created Spark sessions to come out of your everyday existence and learn about this in a new context.</p>
<p>Question: What&#8217;s the next thing on your mind</p>
<p>Answer: It&#8217;s the high and the low. On any given day we have about 20,000 tickets to market.  We also have to think about how to make this a more intimate experience.</p>
<h2>George Clooney</h2>
<p>Actor, Producer, and Humanitarian. Interviewed by Anne Lewness, CMO Adobe</p>
<p>Question: You grew up in KY. You did TV. Became a film star. At this point in your career, what do you want to do.</p>
<p>Answer: Most of your career you were just taking a job.  I almost destroyed the Batman Franchise.  But it was cool at that point.  When you are lucky enough to get choices then you want to do things you would like to see.  I try to do the ones that wouldn&#8217;t get made unless you were there.</p>
<p>Question: So many movies and types. There was a quote, &#8220;It was a total waste of money&#8221;</p>
<p>Answer: I may not have said that but I will say it was a bad film and I did bad in it. I&#8217;ve been in some pretty crappy movies that did quite well.</p>
<p>Question: You&#8217;ve won Oscars, are famous. How do you measure success</p>
<p>Answer: Success is a weird thing and it&#8217;s all subjective. You just need to keep working and not try to measure your own success.  My thought is that whatever I&#8217;m doing next is the thing I&#8217;m most interested in.  It&#8217;s not helpful to go into your award room. I&#8217;ll judge success in my 80&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Question:You once said, &#8220;I think anyone who&#8217;s famous is moron if they are on twitter&#8221;</p>
<p>Answer: Yep, I said that!  Let me give you context around that.  I do think that if you are well known there is only a downside to it. I can get in a lot of trouble on twitter.  Speed can kill you in these kinds of situations.  I&#8217;m certainly capable of stupid things.</p>
<p>Question: If your aren&#8217;t in social media, how do you connect with fans and get feedback.</p>
<p>Answer: I&#8217;d rather meet people in person. There are too much electronics.  There&#8217;s a time for electronics but think about it.</p>
<p>Question: The reviewers of movies today are the viewers</p>
<p>Answer: Yes that&#8217;s true. Although small movies need a professional reviewer. You can&#8217;t &#8220;steal the weekend&#8221; anymore with good trailers and no reviewers.</p>
<p>Question: Technology has changed film making and distribution.  Adobe has a part in that.  How do you feel when you see someone watching your movies on a tablet or phone?</p>
<p>Answer: What&#8217;s happening in our industry is interesting.  TV for a long time had it&#8217;s limitation.  Now TV, Netflix, etc has put up the quality.  It&#8217;s better than some of the films you see.  It&#8217;s miraculous. It&#8217;s great for our industry in general.  It opens up so many avenues in the entertainment industry.  There&#8217;s 5X more work because of that.</p>
<p>Question: it&#8217;s the democratization of film making.</p>
<p>Answer: Remember that as we get older, we&#8217;ve seen pretty much every story ever made.  The new book is filtered to the same story we&#8217;ve seen so much.  But now you can make a movie from a young person on an iphone. It&#8217;s opening up storytelling again.</p>
<p>Question: New topic. You have a bit of  reputation as a prankster. Tell us.</p>
<p>Answer: There are a couple people who are favorite targets. I do horrible things to Richard ?? Brad Pitt is fun. He&#8217;s mean when he comes back.  When doing Ocean&#8217;s. He&#8217;d gotten a prius. I got a bumper that said &#8220;F&#8221; cops.   There&#8217;s no way he&#8217;s not getting arrested.  I got stationary made up with Brad&#8217;s name.  I then sent letters to actors from Brad.  Hilarity ensued.</p>
<p>Question: Do you think you are getting better with age?</p>
<p>Answer; No, I&#8217;m getting older. Most everything is worse with age.  I suppose the only thing is the idea that you are infinitely more comfortable with things. You are more patient. You have a much better sense of humor about yourself.</p>
<p>Question: At Adobe we believe it&#8217;s important to give back.  Silicon Valley hasn&#8217;t been as good about that. You said once that Hollywood reacts rather than leads when it comes to the important things.</p>
<p>Answer: I believe it but it was out of context.  That said, we look to leaders. I grew up in a time where you were expected to participate in the conversation.  In the US, by and large they are charitable. It&#8217;s hard to do the same outside the US.  It&#8217;s a generous country. I feel that our position has to be what can I do more.   it&#8217;s smaller groups that take responsibility and make change.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s the second day of Adobe Summit and the second general session focused more on the personal side of the Experience Wave Adobe highlighted on the first day.</p>
<p>John Mellor, VP Strategy and Business Development, began the session. He introduced Donny Osmond to start.</p>
<p>John and the audience sang a song from Mulan.  The concept: we all crave experiences.  In order to give those experiences to our customers, we have to get outside our comfort zone.</p>
<p>Data is just a piece of the puzzle.  We all &#8220;love&#8217; data.  Some are actual data nerds.  But data alone is useless without context and meaning. Data is sterile, without emotion.  It&#8217;s our job to add meaning.  The human element, the story, adds the experience.</p>
<p>Example: Eiffel tower. 81 stores, 18,000 parts. 2.5 million rivets.  Once you&#8217;ve been to the Eiffel Tower then you have a story.  You remember who you were with, how crowded it was, etc.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s about Data Driven Storytelling.<span id="more-3201"></span></p>
<p>Some key stats</p>

<h2>Mattel President and COO Richard Dixon</h2>
<p>Reinventing the creations company. Mattel&#8217;s story.</p>
<p>Brands; Barbie, American Girl, How Wheels, Fisher Price, etc.</p>
<p>1976: Donny Osmond Fashion Doll. Big hit</p>
<p>2016: Abbie Wambach (US Soccer player)</p>
<p>Mattel has a story in progress in three chapters. It&#8217;s a transformation in progress.</p>
<h3>Chapter One: History</h3>
<p>Founders in 1945 thought of themselves as a creations company. The founders were designers and inventers. They came from a California garage.  The big thing to come from the garage wasn&#8217;t a toy, it was a mind set about bold risks.  They transformed a simple paper fashion doll  into Barbie. They transformed the simple car into Hot Wheels.</p>
<p>The founders bet everything on a new medium, television. They engaged kids with brands long before anyone talked about content strategy.  They formed a partnership with Walt Disney.  In that time, they grew but retained the creator mind set. Think of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Magic 8 ball</li>
<li>Cabbage patch dolls</li>
<li>Othello</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Btu at one point, they lost track of everything. Play was lost and imprisoned in child development.  Everyone was competing for time and the world evolved into an omni-channel universe.  Mattel repeated what worked instead of fearing the status quo.</p>
<p>Mattel suffered. The brands lost relevance.</p>
<h2>Chapter Two: Reinvention</h2>
<p>The roadmap</p>
<ul>
<li>Question evertyhing</li>
<li>Embrace uncertainty</li>
<li>Put results before process</li>
<li>Breakdown process to collaborate</li>
</ul>
<p>First up Barbie. It was the biggest brand challenge.  Barbie had lost it&#8217;s purpose. They listened to Mom, kids, and culture. Girls needed to love Barbie and Mom&#8217;s needed to like her again. Key changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Diversity revolution. 20 new Barbies</li>
<li>Flexible foot (It liberated Barbie from high heels)</li>
<li>Talk back Barbie. Make her talk</li>
<li>Reframed the conversation:
<ul>
<li>Showed key commercial with a girl  as professor.</li>
<li>With a girl as the vet</li>
<li>Soccer coach</li>
<li>Exec</li>
<li>Museum guide</li>
<li>then segway to a girl playing the same situations with Barbies</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Results:</p>
<ul>
<li>50 M views</li>
<li>500M engagements on FB and twitter</li>
<li>81% positive reactions</li>
<li>Trending topic on Yahoo with the new body types</li>
<li>and lots of important people tweeting they like it</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3203" src="/adobe-blog/files/2016/03/Mattel.png" alt="Mattel" width="572" height="500" srcset="/adobe-blog/files/2016/03/Mattel.png 572w, /adobe-blog/files/2016/03/Mattel-300x262.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 572px) 100vw, 572px" /></p>
<h3>Chapter Three</h3>
<p>Now talking about the toy box.</p>
<ul>
<li>They re-invented the View Master. In partnership with Google, they created a virtual reality learning tool.</li>
<li>Fisher Price re-invented. Code-a-pillar.  It can be re-assembled.</li>
<li>New high chair that can be easily disassembled and cleaned in the dishwasher</li>
<li>Thingmaker reinvented.  It&#8217;s now a 3D machine. You can create and print a range of items.</li>
<li>Hot Wheels: Star wards storm trooper car,  Encouraging boys to be more imaginative.  Create on your own. Kits with lots of hacks (OK I wish I had that growing up)</li>
</ul>
<p>Next big leap?</p>
<p>Will re-establish themselves as a creations company. It&#8217;s a child development company like no others.  Focused on pre-teen.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While Adobe Summit has a wide range of focuses, data seems to be a pretty big emphasis, especially with the the data co-0p and key predictive capabilities.  Hence another analytics session.  This particular one focused on best practices and getting past the basics.</p>
<p>He started out with a couple polls, most of the attendees basically love the intellectual stimulation so obviously there were a bunch of data geeks involved.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the end goal?</p>
<p>In ascending order</p>
<ol>
<li>Data exploration</li>
<li>Data visualization</li>
<li>Insights</li>
<li>Action (there is a key chasm between insights and action)</li>
<li>Automated action</li>
<li>Results</li>
</ol>
<p>Some of the questions to ask: what, who, why and then so what.<span id="more-3186"></span></p>
<p><strong>Quote:</strong> What got you here won&#8217;t get you where you want to go</p>
<p><strong>Quote:</strong> Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication (Leanardo DaVinci)  You have to keep your data explanations  as simple as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Key best practice:</strong> Communicate visually. A picture is worth a thousand words.  Use them to better relay key concepts. He showed several examples including some bar charts of pencils.  But the key is to tell a story with the data and visuals.</p>
<p>The same goes for infographics.  You can use various stock photography libraries to make your own infographics.</p>
<p><strong>Best practice:</strong> Tell me what to think.  Don&#8217;t just throw data at it.  Add a little color to highlight things people should see.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good things are green and bad are red btw.</li>
<li>Label the outliers.  you see a peak or a dip, highlight that it was &#8220;Memorial Day&#8221;</li>
<li>Show benchmarks for context.</li>
<li>Avoid the mistake of now showing bad results</li>
<li>Include goals in charts.  Show what you want to achieve vs what you achieved</li>
<li>Show a trended view, not just a point in time.
<ul>
<li>Can also show a trend vs target</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Best Practice:</strong> Align to your corporate objectives.  Then measure yourself in those terms.</p>
<p><strong>Best Practice:</strong> Use composite metrics.  Composite metrics is a combination or index of things with an average.  Nasdaq composite, Dow Jones Index, Quarterback ratings, etc.</p>
<h2>Chris George, VP Product Marketing at Pop Sugar</h2>
<p>Pop Sugar is a media and technology company that caters to 18-35 year old women.  Popsugar.com and shopstyle.com.  Mobile is hitting them in a big way.  Over 70% of visits come from a mobile device.  It&#8217;s really hard to create ads for mobile.   That means they are putting a lot of investment in content marketing (easier on mobile) vs display advertising (banner).</p>
<p>Problem: Marketers are not content creators.</p>
<p>Pop Sugar is focused on using data to identify places to focus on content.   To that end, they&#8217;ve tried very hard to define key content metrics like social sharing.  They created a composite metric: the POPSUGAR engagement score: composits of vists, time spent, social score.  They then plot the composite score over time.   You can then use that data to define what content will have the most relevance to a brand or company.</p>
<p><strong>End result:</strong> Data helps you focus on what content will have the most impact.</p>
<h2>Questions for evaluating your game:</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Are you good at recognizing patterns and breaks in patterns?</li>
<li>Are you better known for the insights you discover or for your ideas or for acting on them?</li>
<li>Are you good at advocating for your ideas?</li>
<li>When someone asks the wrong question, do you answer the question they should have asked?</li>
<li>Do you tend to look for the story in the data of for the data to support your story?</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: this is less about your technical skills and more about just getting the right answers and acting on them.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tamara Gaffney, Principal Analyst Adobe Digital Index and R&#8221;Ray&#8221; Wang, Principal Analyst of Constellation research were ready to make predictions with their big data crystal ball. They took on a variety of topics&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.. all digital marketing related of course.</p>
<p>Note: Big Data refers to the variety of events in the Marketing Cloud including Adobe Analytics.</p>
<p><strong>Looking back:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>in 2015 smartphone visits were up (No duh! right)</li>
<li>Media and entertain ment has a 36.6% uptick</li>
<li>Financial Services up 14.7%</li>
<li>Engagement and converston are still suffering
<ul>
<li>going down on smartphones and desktops</li>
<li>Conversion rates on smartphones are less than half of desktop</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Where are they going</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Tablets have flatlined but no more decline</li>
<li>Smartphones continue to go up. 7% in Jan 2012 to 29% in Jan 2016</li>
<li>Mobile OS visits are stable
<ul>
<li>approx 55% iOS</li>
<li>45% Android slight creep up</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Prediction:</strong> Tablets will come back at some point in time&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.in the form of flexible screens</p>
<p>Screen size will continue to shift.  Don&#8217;t count on this remaining the same</p>
<p><strong>Prediction:</strong> sales and traffic will creep back towards Android.  The Apple trade-in program is bad for Apple pass along use.  Also, Apple is starting to go down market and that has an impact.</p>
<p><span id="more-3175"></span></p>
<p><strong>App World</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There is a steep drop off in app launches</li>
<li>Media, Finance, and Shopping are down
<ul>
<li>Hard to keep these apps in use.</li>
<li>Users have app overload</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Many apps are not just mobile. Many are wifi mode. Media streaming for example</li>
<li>Shopping and Finance have more of a a mobile and smartphone set of use cases</li>
<li>Use cases drive this.  Content consumers spend more time. Transactions take less time</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Prediction</strong>: Biometric authentication will overtake passwords by 2020. This is selfie, heartbeat, fingerprint.  Note: they don&#8217;t take into account privacy law that takes biometrics to NOT be a warrant needy tool.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile Musts for marketers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Mobile is more than a device. It&#8217;s about designing experiences in motion</li>
<li>Make your app easy to authenticate across multiple channel</li>
<li>Think about channel ubiquity or what we call scenes and settings not omni-channel</li>
<li>Study what&#8217;s going on what&#8217;s going on in your Android and iOS base. You will see some interesting shifts including with Android and Samsung Pay</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Search is a crutch for users
<ul>
<li>on mobile devices, there is 76% growth in search. It&#8217;s a &#8220;I hate typing&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>More traffic is going mobile but&#8230;&#8230;. that traffic is not worth as much to you
<ul>
<li>Revenue per visit for mobile was only 50 cents per visit.  So a smart phone is worth 41% less to Google</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Adertising world is throwing more ads on pages&#8230;&#8230; yes we have all seen it</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Prediction:</strong> By Gen Z awareness building marketing will be over.  It&#8217;s a millenial backlash against advertising messing up navigation on mobile. Ray noted that 12 and younger are trained to ignore the ads.</p>
<p>The advertising industry will need to figure out how to make ads count.  Ad bundling may help offset that.</p>
<p><strong>Voice</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Voice rocks our world</li>
<li>Share of digital anticpation
<ul>
<li>Google now 5%
<ul>
<li>Tamara doesn&#8217;t think Google in is the catbird seat.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Windows cortana 5%</li>
<li>Siri 5% Amazon</li>
<li>Echo 2% (most admired btw)</li>
<li>Facebook M 20%
<ul>
<li>Facebook volume has gone up.  People in the 30-50 demographic are going back to Facebook</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This is an open battleground</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advertising Play</strong></p>
<p>Awareness must tie back to brand promise</p>
<p><strong>Future of Entertainment</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>TV everywhere has pickdd up.  17.4%</li>
<li>But kids are at 83% in Teens and Toons genre
<ul>
<li>This is quarter over quarter growth</li>
<li>Kids are watching youtube videos</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Live TV other than sports and election coverage is dead</li>
<li>What are they using to watch tv
<ul>
<li>Apple TV is winning at 10%</li>
<li>But Roku is growing faster.  Roku put out a hi-definition box</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gaming is huge
<ul>
<li>League of legends MOBA is bigger than all other sports</li>
<li>Kids like to watch videos of games being played</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Kids are content consumers and creators
<ul>
<li>They want more content faster</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Prediction:</strong> Android OS TV&#8217;s will cut into Apple TV. It will change the game yet again.  Multi-channel will help drive this.  (Move from phone to home to travel)</p>
<p><strong>Prediction:</strong> Context will be your new mantra.  It&#8217;s about engaging correctly where they are</p>
<p>If you put together these then you&#8217;ve  got good context</p>
<ol>
<li>Identity</li>
<li>Time</li>
<li>Location</li>
<li>Weather</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What to do</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Get a gaming strategy</li>
<li>Gaming is the new advertising opportunity</li>
<li>Expect a convergence of mobile and tv operating systems to shift engagement and consumptiong</li>
<li>Contextually relevant content is the future</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Future of &#8220;Stuff&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Showed a video. With content everywhere, there will be no channel.  You will surface content and apps in windows, stove tops, cars, walls, etc.</p>
<p>Internet of things received with joyful anticipation</p>
<ul>
<li>35% are looking forward to the IoT with smart devices interacting more contextually</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Prediction:</strong> IoT will become mission critical</p>
<p><strong>Prediction:</strong> IoT rollercoaster reaches a peak then takes a steep dive.  Nest with huge bakloas over product outage with baby monitors.  High tech cars facing greater reliability challenges.  See the drone wars.</p>
<p><strong>Prediction</strong>: Bandwidth becomes a public utility.  Bandwidth demand will increase but providers are losing revenue. Prices for bandwidth will go up.  Content delivery and time may change.</p>
<p><strong>Augmented and Virtual Reality</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Oculus Rift was a big thing at South By Southwest
<ul>
<li>Still won&#8217;t come out for a bit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In Utah, they opened a virtual reality gaming place called the void
<ul>
<li>Showed a promo video (below)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Prediction</strong>: VR impacts B2B, healthcare, and gaming first.</p>
<p>How to think about IoT</p>
<ul>
<li>With iot think about scenes and settings and not channels</li>
<li>Value is the contextual insights to make better recommendations</li>
<li>AR and VR have both active and passive approaches to transform experience</li>
<li>Connectivity requires intention driven approach</li>
</ul>
<h3>What else?</h3>
<p>Marketers cannot reassemble fractured identities on your own.  Customers have on average 7.2 devices but on average, a given site only sees 1.2 devices per month in logged in mode.</p>
<p>Prediction: 2016 will be your year of identity.  You want to map experiences and journeys. Identity allows it and users may allow you that information for the convenience. Of course, the battle for identity is everywhere. They all want a piece of your identity or owning that authentication.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jon Bates Group Product Manger Data Science and Machine Learning, gave a session on how to gear up for higher analytics maturity.  Most people have nailed descriptive analytics but are now being pushed to take it to the next level.  Jon wants to provide a vision of what that maturity is.</p>
<p>How to do it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get your core services up so that insights can be actioned</li>
<li>Free up your time by delivering self-service analysis to the business</li>
<li>Get strategic</li>
</ol>
<p>Predictive analytics is like planning for a Marathon. It&#8217;s a series of steps.   You start simple with a 5K and then move on to a 10K, half marathon, and finally a full marathon. Here are the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Descriptive analytics (tactical) &#8211; what happened</li>
<li>Diagnostic analytics &#8211; why</li>
<li>Advanced diagnostic analytics &#8211; why and for whom</li>
<li>Predictive analytics (strategic) &#8211; what&#8217;s next or what could happen</li>

<h2>How do you get there?  The Analytics Plan</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s about freeing up your time and where to get started.  It&#8217;s an analytics maturity plan.</p>
<h3>Descriptive Analytics</h3>

<li>Easy to interpret and explain</li>
<li>Deploy the models for real-time decisions and personalization</li>
<li>need Analytics Premium Complete or Premium Predictive Analytics</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Elevating the Role of Analytics</h2>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget one key aspect here. You have to organize for success.  You can take a variety of approaches like centralized, COE, consulting, functioal, and decentralized.  Turns out consulting is the least effective. Centralized or COE is the most able to allow you to mature.</p>
<p><strong>Key Consideration</strong>: nurture a mutualistic relationship between analysts and data scientists.  (get data scientists if you don&#8217;t have them.</p>
<p>Next steps</p>
<ol>
<li>Get strategic. Evangelize the insights and become the secret weapon to the C-Suite</li>
<li>Key strategies
<ol>
<li>be a trust builder</li>
<li>go the extra mile to foster learning</li>
<li>Be the guide to which the enterprise turns</li>
<li>Speak your audience&#8217;s language</li>
<li>Tell the enterprise what&#8217;s possible</li>
</ol>

<h3>RBS Head of Analytics Gile Richardson</h3>
<p>Let me tell you about a program called superstar DJ&#8217;s. We wanted this to be a customer focused data driven slice of awesomeness.</p>
<p>About RBS: 25 million global customers with assets of $1.7 trillion.  Aim is to be the number 1 bank in the UI for service, advocacy and trust.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t always the case the RBS managed their experiences. &#8220;We were terrible&#8221;   it was a firework culture.  Light up a new experience and launch it.  The changes were made by gut feel and included a long backlog  but they didn&#8217;t have enough data and weren&#8217;t looking at it.   Reports were in text. It was hard to find meaningfull patterns in the data.</p>
<p>How do you become Superstar DJ&#8217;s</p>
<ul>
<li>First, look at the journey.  They divided the digital team into journey managers throughout the customer lifecycle</li>
<li>Chose a CMS in AEM</li>
<li>Implemented tag management for a single view of the entire journey
<ul>
<li>DTM</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Democratize the data 110 live data dashboards
<ul>
<li>Used Adobe analytics for all the journey managers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Begin optimization
<ul>
<li>but how to manage the resource issue</li>
<li>The answer is that it&#8217;s for everyone.  Everyone needed to do it.</li>
<li>Gave them the tools, training, and support to do it.</li>
<li>Began a nice cycle
<ul>
<li>Learn</li>
<li>Collaborate for change
<ul>
<li>Worked with producers</li>
<li>Do all the changes in the marketing cloud</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Test it
<ul>
<li>No change goes online without it being tested first</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How did this work?
<ul>
<li>Made it fun</li>
<li>Maxed out the music theme with the team</li>
<li>Used billboard charts</li>
<li>promoted healthy competition</li>
<li>Got the entire team on board</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Highlighted the NatWest site
<ul>
<li>Mobile and legacy experience</li>
<li>Highlighted new product with the reward account</li>
<li>Showed a real time cross device stitching of an experience
<ul>
<li>Also highlighted key messages in the reward account</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Numbers
<ul>
<li>H1 2014 did 2 tests</li>
<li>2015 did 400 tests</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Last thoughts;
<ul>
<li>Be fearless. experiment and pull back if it doesn&#8217;t work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Quote</strong>: We are a 300 year old bank and are proud of our history. But we are more concerned about the last 10 seconds of our customer experience online.</p>
<h3>Adobe Data Science Magic</h3>
<p>Are adding several</p>
<ul>
<li>Virtual analyst</li>
<li>Asset auto-tagging</li>

<h3>Key New Announcements</h3>
<h4>Adobe Co-op</h4>
<p>Problem: we market to devices.  It&#8217;s not to people.  It&#8217;s a blind spot when your typical use had 3-7 devices.</p>
<p><strong>New product:</strong> the Adobe Marketing Cloud Device Co-op.  Looking for your participation.</p>
<p>The power of a login is the key to this.  An average brand can only link 10% of interactions with a login.  The Co-op extends what you know about a customer to more.</p>
<p>By focusing  on people, you can better allocate your spend.   The co-op will be integrated into analytics.  The device cop-op will also let you know about additional devices for people..  Tracking people and not devices, lets you better target your user using that context.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy</strong>: Does this without sharing personal data and includes an opt-out.</p>
<p>Will be rolling the Co-op out to more customers over the coming year.  Talk to your Adobe Rep.</p>
<h4>Availability of Adobe.io Developer Portal</h4>
<p>Just rolling out the portal</p>
<h4>Adobe Exchange program for marketing cloud</h4>
<p>Get better access to technology and innovate</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Mobile Experiences</h4>
<p>Mobile has become how you engage with your brand.  Recently announced at Mobile World Congress some key new functionality</p>
<p>Demo</p>
<ul>
<li>Did a search on mobile on bike helmets</li>
<li>Saw an REI ad and clicked on it</li>
<li>Invited to install the mobile app</li>
<li>Installed it
<ul>
<li>Note: now to correctly assign attribution across the install</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After launching the installed app, allowed Geo tracking
<ul>
<li>and were immediately shown the helmet section</li>
<li>This is deferred deep-linking and gave a continuous experience for the user</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Then showed a push message to show e nearby store
<ul>
<li>Can draw a geo-fence around a location</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Walked towards the store. The app then showed the smart bag</li>
<li>The bag is an IoT device. It has bluetooth and RFID
<ul>
<li>Paired the phone by bumping the bag.</li>
<li>Added product to the bag and automatically added it to the cart</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Walked away and checked out the user with a complete transaction
<ul>
<li>Note: go see the immersive retail experience on the show floor</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Scale</h4>
<p>it&#8217;s about Data and Speed.  Marketers don&#8217;t have a clear view of what&#8217;s important.</p>
<p>New Capabilties</p>
<ul>
<li>Segment comparison
<ul>
<li>Bring 3rd party data to audience manager. Now you can reports on that information as well</li>
<li>Can compare segments and with more dimensions</li>
<li>In demo, showed a lost cart.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can take the lost cart and react in real time
<ul>
<li>Can put a number of triggers on the site</li>
<li>Demo: Las Vegas event trigger and focus on the most loyal customers and frequency on the trigger fire</li>
<li>This trigger led to an email to the lost cart user.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Deadpool and their social campaign with an irreverent tone.  It led to a huge grossing film</li>
<li>Mastercard started their Priceless surprises campaign in digital form</li>
<li>Digital Experience has made it easy to book your theme park vacation</li>
<li>Retail digital experiences continually make it easier to</li>
<li>Shantanu booked a ticket to the last Kobe Bryant game all online flights, hotel, ticket.</li>
</ul>
<p>Digital experiences need to be provocative and predictive.</p>
<p><strong>Quote:</strong> This is the experience era</p>
<p>Experiences are the basis for new competition.</p>
<p><strong>Quote:</strong> No one wants to be disrupted by an upstart with a better solution</p>
<p>Experiences and the technology to deliver it has become more important.  Now it&#8217;s about using data to create that exeprience.</p>
<p><span id="more-3166"></span></p>
<p>Adobe organizes itself:</p>
<ol>
<li>Digital Media (Creative Cloud)</li>
<li>Digital Document (Adobe Document Cloud)</li>
<li>Digital Marketing (Adobe Marketing Cloud)</li>
<li>(anyone see a theme going on?)</li>
</ol>
<p>Shantanu then went on to talk about how these three clouds will become part of the Adobe.core platform. It will be part of a larger ecosystem.  Think about what that means btw.  This is n&#8217;t just integrating Marketing Cloud but integrating it all.</p>
<p><strong>Adobe</strong> <strong>Mission</strong>: Changing the world through digital experiences</p>
<h2>Brad Rencher: EVP and GM Digital Marketing</h2>
<p>Summit Data:</p>
<ul>
<li>The entire C Suite is in the room</li>
<li>Data scientists</li>
<li>Architects</li>
<li>Manager</li>
<li>Developers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Quote</strong>: Digital Marketing is not about Adobe, you, your partners. It&#8217;s about PEOPE</p>
<p><strong>Quote</strong>: Marketers are caretakers of the customer experience</p>
<p>The need to understand data and to &#8220;know&#8221; your customers is becoming more challenging.  it&#8217;s the internet of things.  Customers want the experience to be consistent, continuous, and compelling.  Enterprises will be forced to transform in ways they haven&#8217;t needed to for decades. It will change how you do what you do.</p>
<p>This enterprise disruption is the third:</p>
<ol>
<li>Back office wave: manufacturing processes, six sigma, paper forms in to do boxes
<ol>
<li>How do we implement and train these employees to use them.</li>
<li>ERP was a key component of this&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.although it&#8217;s no longer a differentiator.  It&#8217;s table stakes</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Front office wave: Replace the rolodex with CRM.
<ol>
<li>Now CRM is ubiquitous</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Experience business wave: it also spawns from new technology but has one key difference
<ol>
<li>It&#8217;s not about the company. It&#8217;s about the consumer. It&#8217;s about create a great experience</li>
<li>It&#8217;s about nothing: do you job so well that it&#8217;s seamless and you, the company, don&#8217;t exist</li>
<li>It also means that the entire organization are stewards of the experience</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The Experience Business Wave is the new competitive battleground. It&#8217;s democratic. Everyone has a voice.</p>
<p>In 15 years, over half the Fortune 500 has turned over.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Are you an Experience Business?</p>
<p>Key components of an Experience Business</p>
<ol>
<li>Know me and respect me</li>
<li>Speak to me in one voice; always in context</li>
<li>Make technology transparent. the medium is not the message, the experience is.</li>
<li>Delight me at every turn: it disrupts itself</li>
</ol>
<p>Take Moore&#8217;s law in technology.  The law of experience says that a customers expectation of experience will double every year. Take some good examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>Delta: they know me from when I book a ticket to my flight</li>
<li>HBO Go: consume my content where I want</li>
<li>McDonalds and all day breakfast</li>
</ol>
<h2>Deborah Wahl: SVP and CMO McDonalds</h2>
<p>Question: what have you been working on</p>
<p>Answer: We have been working on changing all aspects of the customer experience. It&#8217;s food, brand value, etc.  We brought in fresh cracked eggs, fresh chicken, and a host of other changes including all day breakfast.  We ended 2015 as the second highest performing stock and had our largest Q4 profit in history</p>
<p>Question: All day breakfast did that?</p>
<p>Answer: the best fast food hack in history is the hamburger and the Egg McMuffing</p>
<p>Question: talk to us about the brand transformation</p>
<p>Answer: The big transformation is on the digital side. We started investing in digital.  We knew we had to go from Mass to Mass Personalization. We have a lot more work to do.  18 months ago we didn&#8217;t have an app, we had only one way to order, response times were in the hours.</p>
<p>Now we are at a response time in minutes. We now have an app. We are more aligned with our customer.</p>
<p>After 25 years in marketing it&#8217;s still changing every day</p>
<p>Question: the product is pretty analog and will remain that way for a while.  How do you blend digital and analog</p>
<p>Answer: We have to deliver on expectations and giving a consistent brand experience.  The best way to deliver the convenience is to follow what the customers are saying.  McDonalds customers wanted offers as their number one ask.</p>
<p>Question: How do you deal with scale.  In the US you are talking about 26 million customers every day</p>
<p>Answer: In digital there are a lot of shiny toys. We had to step back and focus on timing and balance.  We did mobile pay.  But we have to think about scale. We have a mention in social every 1.5 seconds.  We have to take that into account.  Figure out what you can do first. Solve the priority.  That takes a lot of discipline.</p>
<p>Question: How is the Hamburgler dealing with all this change?</p>
<p>Answer: He grew up. He&#8217;s hot and cool now. He&#8217;s digitally savvy.</p>
<p>Question: What are emerging trends you are thinking about embracing</p>
<p>Answer: We created a virtual reality happy meal box at South by Southwest. You could play paintball in the happy meal.  In Sweden, they did a thing on virtual reality glasses.  We are looking at partnering with Ford.</p>
<p>Look at the day to day.  It&#8217;s about the big changes you can implement.  Take our wifi network.  In Texas, they love the local messaging. 350% increase in click throughs because of that.  The bigger gain comes from the very practical approach to building a business</p>

<p>Who uses the site:<span id="more-913"></span></p>
<p>Builders</p>
<ul>
<li>Community administrators</li>
<li>Content and brand managers</li>
</ul>
<p>Members</p>
<ul>
<li>Community Manager &#8211; not a company employee but is a trusted individual</li>
<li>Community members &#8211; those who have joined the site and participate in the communities. (likes, voting, article creation, commenting</li>
<li>Community User &#8211; a simple viewer of the content</li>
</ul>
<h3>Let&#8217;s Build a Community Site</h3>
<p>Pain Point: I need something now and I need it to be simple. A business user should be able to do this.</p>
<p>They showed a live demo of the new Communities. It will be released on May 7th.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rebecca is a community administrator
<ul>
<li>She already has a couple communities up and running but needs a new one</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The new version has the revised UI which matches the themes from Marketing Cloud</li>
<li>In administration page of the new UI
<ul>
<li>Each community has a set of building blocks called community functions
<ul>
<li>Activity Stream</li>
<li>Forum</li>
<li>Group</li>
<li>Page</li>
<li>Assignments</li>
<li>File Library</li>
<li>each is a normal AEM component but already wired together for community context</li>
<li>Blogs and calendars are coming soon</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>AEM provides a number of reference site templates you can use or choose to make your own
<ul>
<li>These templates have a structure tab that shows what functions are used in that template</li>
<li>You can add additional functions to any communities via a drag and drop interface</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The concept of group is a place where community members can have sub-communities
<ul>
<li>Still uses the same building blocks</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is a new wizard to create a community site
<ul>
<li>Press a create site button</li>
<li>Fill in key information like Title, description, community name, and default template</li>
<li>Choose which design you want. This is the theme, color, etc.
<ul>
<li>based on twitter bootstrap so that&#8217;s where the default themes are derived</li>
<li>It&#8217;s fully responsive</li>
<li>Can add your own branding</li>
<li>Can configure basic things like a header image</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Define options like
<ul>
<li>allow self registration</li>
<li>allow anonymous access</li>
<li>allow private messaging</li>
<li>allow social logins like Facebook or Twitter</li>
<li>other settings include
<ul>
<li>Tags for the community</li>
<li>Moderation
<ul>
<li>Is it moderated</li>
<li>flagging threshold</li>
<li>definition of community moderators (admins or members)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Group Management
<ul>
<li>Can create sub-groups, admins for those groups, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Translation
<ul>
<li>Define default language</li>
<li>Check a box to allow machine translation into multiple languages</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>hit the finish button and you get a new site</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Created the site but then went to another existing community that had more content</li>
<li>Reporting: Not in this release. It&#8217;s coming shortly after</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Second pain point</strong>: I don&#8217;t want a rigid community. Make it easy to administer</p>
<p>Back to the demo but from a content manager standpoint</p>
<ul>
<li>Login gives a number of options like sites, moderation of site, users, etc.</li>
<li>As a content manager, the manager has flexibility to put features on different pages and parts of pages.</li>
<li>Uses the same layout tools from AEM Web Content Management
<ul>
<li>Add an image</li>
<li>add a community function</li>
<li>Preview in responsive scenarios</li>
<li>resizing of images</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can also do targeting and personalization within the community</li>
</ul>
<p>Now switch to the community manager (non-employees who help to manage the site)</p>
<p>This is a manage groups and moderate content scenario</p>
<ul>
<li>From the web site (community is a sub-site)
<ul>
<li>Community manager can login and see the community manager options</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The UI lets you do moderation for each piece of content in context (e.g. no admin screen, just embedded in the normal page)
<ul>
<li>Reply, Flag, Delete, Edit, Deny</li>
<li>Flag puts it in a workflow</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Does have access to the administration link
<ul>
<li>This includes bulk administration option</li>
<li>Find all flagged content</li>
<li>approve any content</li>
<li>deny or delete the content</li>
<li>Search can be for status of content (pending , approved, denied, closed)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As a group manager, the user accesses and manages the group(s)
<ul>
<li>Can add a new group to the community site</li>
<li>Invite users
<ul>
<li>Use a type ahead to find users</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make the group public or private</li>
<li>Choose a group template</li>
<li>add an image</li>
<li>Post has a rich text editor embedded
<ul>
<li>can also attach images or files</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pain Point</strong>: Has to have a rich community experience. More than just a forum.</p>
<ul>
<li>Members can see private messages in their inbox (assuming it&#8217;s allowed)</li>
<li>The activity stream lets you see what&#8217;s happening in all the community functions.
<ul>
<li>Has a following concept within the community
<ul>
<li>follow users and pages</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Activity stream only shows activities for people / content you follow. Content includes threads</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can update your personal profile</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fifth Persona: Community Users</strong></p>
<p>Pain Point: find it online and make it available via multiple devices</p>
<ul>
<li>By default, this user is not logged in.</li>
<li>The pages use a nice structure to allow it to be easily indexed
<ul>
<li>Google can thus find the public content</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>has an internal search as well</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So as you can see, each user type has a robust set of functionality available to them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the first year where travel and hospitality is a core and strategic vertical.</p>
<p>Stats:</p>
<ol>
<li>50% of your customers start their travel journey with no brand in mind</li>
<li>100% of your customers expect a to be remembered by their airline or hotel</li>
</ol>
<p>This is about &#8220;marketing&#8221; beyond marketing. In other words, support the entire experience, not just a lead.  If you have a flow that includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dreaming</li>
<li>Research</li>
<li>Booking</li>
<li>Prepare</li>
<li>Experience</li>
<li>Loyalty</li>
</ul>
<p>Then you should treat them like you know them throughout that cycle.<span id="more-892"></span></p>
<p><strong>Quote</strong>: In general, our biggest issues would be the every rising customer expectations driven by technology. (Best Western CEO David Kong)</p>
<p>Three themes:</p>
<ol>
<li>To win the future, you need to optimize convenience.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s about mobility&#8230;&#8230;. not just mobile. You need to evaluate your mobile platform at the user level</li>
<li>Marketing and technology teams need to be connected.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Julie Hoffman &#8211; MGM Interview</h3>
<p>Julie is a Senior Executive Director at MGM.  MGM is an <strong>Entertainment</strong> company.  They are NOT a technology company.  Memory is important but it takes amplification and frequency to move from short term to long term memory.   Correlate this to MGM&#8217;s goal to build great experiences.  MGM co-creates in their customers experience.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: How does convenience play into the customer journey</p>
<p>Time is the ultimate short commodity.  You only have so much of it. You cannot afford to waste their time on the phone choosing options. The burden does not belong to the customer.  MGM wants to take the burden back.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> How has MGM done their transformation</p>
<p>Started with a customer experience committee. We formed a vision and a strategy.  That led to alignment by organization with a Chief Experience Officer and a continuing journey</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: What is the one thing Marketers in this industry need to do?</p>
<p>Realize that there is a whole community there to help.  This is cross-industry. Lots of people are willing to help.</p>
<h3>Future Vision in Technology</h3>
<p>Showed a video on a completely integrated experience</p>
<ul>
<li>Checkin</li>
<li>See your friends who are also in town</li>
<li>order room service from your phone</li>
<li>Your phone is key</li>
<li>Housekeeping users their app to see your preferences and whether you are in your room</li>
<li>Extend your stay and book a concert</li>
<li>Visit the spa with points</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>This was all created using a storyscape approach that combines brand strategy, product placement, customer experience, to create the journey.</p>
<p>He showed a travel experience cloud. It&#8217;s a dense slide put into key streams:</p>
<ol>
<li>Analytics</li>
<li>traveler touchpoints</li>
<li>platofmr services</li>
<li>relationship management services (media buy, booking, pricing, etc)</li>
<li>Core systems</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a nice way to combine all the pieces and parts.</p>
<p><strong>Stats</strong>: 95% want to deliver a great customer experience. 80% say they deliver a superior experience.  <strong>Only 8%</strong> of customers feel they receive a customer experience.  (Closing the delivery gap study by Bain)</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot of room for improvement.</p>
<p><strong>From &#8212; To</strong></p>
<p>Channels and Platforms to Experiences</p>
<p>Silo-ed moments to ongoing journey</p>
<p>Bookings to Trips</p>
<p>Messaging to Engagement</p>
<p>Isolated Scores to Holistic Measurement</p>
<p>Employees to Heroes</p>
<p>Travelers to People</p>
<h3>Chad Westfall of IHG : Reinventing Digital Content Delivery</h3>
<p>Chad shared a personal experience.   He was speaking at a Marketing Symposium and had a taxi experience where the cab driver had to use a really large map book just to find his destination&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; all while the meter was ticking.  Chad contrasted this with Uber and the connected experience.  Chad felt very uncomfortable in this disconnected world.</p>
<p>In 2014, IHG&#8217;s digital channel surpassed $5 billion in sales.  That&#8217;s 20% of overall sales. 360 million visits to the website.</p>
<p>IHG&#8217;s Challenge: not giving a rich experience to their customers.</p>
<p>They have to do it in 16 languages, 200 countries, a heavy stack that hampers ability to make change.  On top of that, page delivery performance was abysmal.</p>
<p><strong>Reinvention</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>system architecture
<ol>
<li>realized they needed to completely separate commerce from content</li>
<li>Decoupled the system, modularized the code, and enabled new delivery systems outside of the commerce component</li>
<li>Deployment: used akamai to cache the content</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>how we interact with systems
<ol>
<li>AEM</li>
<li>Business creates content</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>localization process
<ol>
<li>Brought in Smartling as a translation partner.  This tool had to support unified translation memory and supported automation of translation</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>global delivery model
<ol>
<li>akamai caching</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Results:</p>
<ul>
<li>65% reducstion in delivery time</li>
<li>75% reduction in language rollout</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Hotel Experience</span></p>
<p>IHG just stared an implementation of Adobe Audience Manger to create that experience in the hotel. It&#8217;s just the start of the journey.</p>
