		<description><![CDATA[Hi Nono,



Please see our implementation here:



/adobe-blog/files/2016/05/visionapi.zip



You will need to edit the VisionApiServiceAccount.json file and insert your own project_id, private_key_id, private_key, client_email, and client_id.



Thanks,



Shannon Sumner]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Shannon for your reply.
I looked at the pricing and that seems quite reasonable.  Let&#039;s see what the pricing model for Adobe Smart Tags will be.

Any chance that you can share your implementation?

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Nono,

As far as I know, Google;s Cloud Vision API does not restrict the amount of calls made through a key.  Anything over a thousand inquiries a month will cost a bit.  Pricing can be found here:  https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/pricing.

It does look like a batch mode is supported up to 4MB (https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/image-best-practices#google_cloud_storage_image_files).    The larger the image, the more Google will be able to accurately label the image.  Since images usually run pretty big - batch processing is not realistic.

We extended the existing DAM workflow instead of creating a custom workflow for expediency sake.  The process has evolved since this blog post.  We now use an event listener to observe when a node of type &quot;nt:file&quot; is added to the DAM.  We then check the size of this asset.  If the size is under 4MB - we send the file to Google&#039;s Cloud Vision API.  If it is over 4MB, we send a rendition of the asset.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Very nice.
Does the Google Cloud Vision API restricts the amount of calls made through a key?
Any batch mode supported?
Also why extend the existing DAM Workflow instead of creating a custom workflow with custom launcher.

But overall very nice!]]></description>
