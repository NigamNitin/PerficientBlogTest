				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The healthcare industry has been in a constant state of change the last several years, from new laws and regulations to technologies and medicine. To top it off, patient behavior has drastically changed.</p>
<p>According to a Commonwealth Fund study, the average American visits the doctor <strong>only four times per year</strong> and that number is declining. One of the drivers behind this behavioral change is accessibility to medical information.</p>
<p>Here’s a great example – in a study of millennials by ZocDoc, it was reported that this group is more likely to research symptoms online, with 28% self-diagnosing and 36% self-medicating before seeing a doctor.</p>
<p>When patients only see doctors when they’re sick or injured, it impacts the overall quality of care they could receive. With a more complete view of a patient, healthcare professionals can provide in-depth care and counsel that focuses on overall wellness or even detect the onset of a chronic condition.</p>
<p>Creating a connected health experience that’s ingrained in patients’ daily lives is one solution, and the need has never been greater to help doctors and hospital systems support their patients digitally.</p>
<p>Our team at Perficient developed DailyDose, a patient engagement app built on Adobe Experience Manager Mobile. With a solution that aligns with consumer/patient behaviors, this will support lowering patient readmissions, driving lower healthcare costs and increasing patient engagement.</p>
<p>Watch the video for a peek at DailyDose.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter" src="/adobe-blog/files/2016/03/aem-mobile-banner.png" alt="AEM Mobile" /></p>
<p>Recently, Adobe introduced <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/aemmobile/2016/02/announcing-adobe-experience-manager-mobile.html">AEM Mobile</a>, a new way to build, maintain and deploy mobile apps. AEM Mobile makes it vastly easier to manage mobile apps by enabling marketers to maintain mobile app content, which has traditionally been done by developers. AEM Mobile is the centerpiece of a new platform Adobe has built around enabling marketing to maintain mobile apps and market to mobile app users.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://solutionpartners.adobe.com/fragments/partners/a1X30000000YGZiEAO.html">one of Adobe&#8217;s top partners</a>, Perficient had a chance to preview AEM Mobile and get a glimpse into the technology underlying this new platform.</p>
<p><span id="more-3057"></span></p>
<h2>The Tech Behind the Scenes</h2>
<p>This new platform is composed of several different technologies, each of which has been deeply integrated, to build a seamless mobile app publishing experience.</p>
<div style="clear: both;">
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3060" style="float: left; padding: 10px;" src="/adobe-blog/files/2016/03/Adobe-DPS-Logo.png" alt="Adobe DPS Logo" srcset="/adobe-blog/files/2016/03/Adobe-DPS-Logo.png 233w, /adobe-blog/files/2016/03/Adobe-DPS-Logo-150x150.png 150w, /adobe-blog/files/2016/03/Adobe-DPS-Logo-144x144.png 144w" sizes="(max-width: 233px) 100vw, 233px" /></p>
<h3>Adobe Digital Publishing Suite: Easy maintenance of mobile app content</h3>
<p><a href="https://digitalpublishing.acrobat.com/welcome.html">Adobe Digital Publishing Suite (or DPS)</a>, which Adobe unveiled in 2010, provides Marketers the ability to maintain mobile app content without having to involve developers or resubmit apps through the app store. This tool has been used by numerous organizations to manage their apps, however it does have some limits. DPS, does not give full access to the mobile APIs and has limited functionality compared to native apps. Adobe Mobile takes what is best about DPS, the Marketing content management and integrates it into the powerful PhoneGap platform.</p>
</div>
<div style="clear: both;">
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3062" style="float: left; padding: 10px;" src="/adobe-blog/files/2016/03/PhoneGap-Logo.png" alt="PhoneGap Logo" /></p>
<h3>Adobe PhoneGap: Publish apps across all mobile platforms</h3>
<p><a href="http://phonegap.com/">Adobe PhoneGap</a> is a powerful platform for publishing multi-platform mobile apps. These apps are built with HTML and CSS and are wrapped in a native app wrapper. The deep API integrations and powerful rendering engines in modern phones allows these apps to compete in performance and features with native apps without requiring separate development efforts for each platform. By integrating Adobe PhoneGap into AEM Mobile, Adobe has unleashed the power of the PhoneGap platform and integrated with the ease of content publication provided by Adobe Experience Manager and Adobe Digital Publishing Suite.</p>
</div>
<div style="clear: both;">
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3063" style="float: left; padding: 10px;" src="/adobe-blog/files/2016/03/AEM-Logo.png" alt="AEM Logo" /></p>
<h3>Adobe Experience Manager: Author content &amp; managed digital assets in an friendly interface</h3>
<p>In AEM Mobile, <a href="http://www.adobe.com/marketing-cloud/enterprise-content-management.html">Adobe Experience Manager</a> extends it&#8217;s powerful content authoring and Digital Asset Management features to enable marketers to manage and deploy mobile apps through a familiar and intuitive user interface. In AEM Mobile, mobile content authors can use the same drag and drop features to build their mobile app content via reusable components.</p>
</div>
<div style="clear: both;">
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3059" style="float: left; padding: 10px;" src="/adobe-blog/files/2016/03/Adobe-Analytics-Logo.png" alt="Adobe Analytics Logo" srcset="/adobe-blog/files/2016/03/Adobe-Analytics-Logo.png 233w, /adobe-blog/files/2016/03/Adobe-Analytics-Logo-150x150.png 150w, /adobe-blog/files/2016/03/Adobe-Analytics-Logo-144x144.png 144w" sizes="(max-width: 233px) 100vw, 233px" /></p>
<h3>Adobe Analytics: Quick &amp; easy measurement of mobile interactions</h3>
<p>Adobe has created a version of <a href="http://www.adobe.com/marketing-cloud/web-analytics.html">Adobe Analytics</a> specifically targeted at measuring mobile app interactions. Of course, companies can still integrate with Adobe Analytics Standard and Premium to get the full breadth of measurement possibilities, but this mobile-specific framework enables quick and low-effort measurement of a large number of mobile-specific interactions.</p>
</div>
<div style="clear: both;">
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3061" style="float: left; padding: 10px;" src="/adobe-blog/files/2016/03/Adobe-Target-Logo.png" alt="Adobe Target Logo" srcset="/adobe-blog/files/2016/03/Adobe-Target-Logo.png 233w, /adobe-blog/files/2016/03/Adobe-Target-Logo-150x150.png 150w, /adobe-blog/files/2016/03/Adobe-Target-Logo-144x144.png 144w" sizes="(max-width: 233px) 100vw, 233px" /></p>
<h3>Adobe Target: Deliver dynamic content</h3>
<p>Along with the <a href="/blogs.perficient.com/digexplatforms/2016/01/05/are-you-ready-for-at-js/">new AT.js</a>, Adobe has released a version of <a href="http://www.adobe.com/marketing-cloud/testing-targeting.html">Adobe Target</a> geared for mobile apps. Using Adobe Target, marketers can deliver dynamic content to users to market within the device, increasing relevance, conversion rates and engagement.</p>
</div>
<h2 style="clear: both;">Bringing it all Together</h2>
<p>By combining all of these technologies into a single platform, Adobe has created a mobile app platform with unparalleled features, flexibility and ease of use. No longer should mobile apps be separate from the rest of your digital marketing technology or should they be unmeasured or un-marketed. By leveraging, AEM Mobile you can build and maintain more apps and derive more value out of every dollar you put into mobile.</p>
<p>Perficient is extremely excited by the possibilities offered by AEM Mobile and for <a href="http://summit.adobe.com" target="_blank">Adobe Summit</a>, we have some very special demos planned to demonstrate the potential of the platform. Stay tuned for the second part of this blog series for more information!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Adobe is making a name for itself in the area of digital marketing.  Marketers know that data is necessary to make key decisions and I&#8217;m glad to see Adobe providing leadership in this area. When it comes to data about mobile usage, Adobe has published their <a title="State of Mobility Benchmark" href="http://success.adobe.com/assets/en/downloads/whitepaper/13926_di_mobile_benchmark_final.pdf" target="_blank">State of Mobile</a> study on their website, available to anybody. <a href="https://blogs.perficient.com/portals/wp-content/blogs.dir/3/files/2013/10/marquee-di-mobile-benchmark-709x300.png"><img class="alignright  wp-image-6578" alt="marquee-di-mobile-benchmark-709x300" src="https://blogs.perficient.com/portals/wp-content/blogs.dir/3/files/2013/10/marquee-di-mobile-benchmark-709x300-600x253.png" width="420" height="177" /></a></p>
<p>This study highlights some important data about mobile usage, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tablets have overtaken phones in the amount of traffic they drive. Think about that. Modern tablets were introduced in 2010. In just 2+ years, they have taken over smartphone traffic.</li>
<li>In the Retail industry, tablets are preferred, while in Telecom phones are preferred by a wide margin.</li>
<li>Since February 2012, iOS has overtaken Android (again) for browsing</li>
<li>Video has grown by 300% on mobile devices, however, the desktop still accounts for almost 90% of video browsing.</li>
<li>For online shoppers, tablet users are 3 times more likely to buy versus smartphone users.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is all good data for those people who are targeting mobile devices.  I&#8217;m looking forward to more of these types of studies from Adobe.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Forrester has just released The Forrester Wave for Mobile Collaboration, which does a very good job of highlighting who the leaders are in this market.  The image below shows the Forrester Wave; you can access the full report at <a title="Mobile Collaboration Wave" href="http://www.forrester.com/rb/Research/wave%26trade%3B_mobile_collaboration%2C_q3_2011/q/id/59284/t/2" target="_blank">forrester.com</a>.</p>
<p>What is interesting is that the report includes only those companies that have native applications on <em>multiple</em> mobile operating systems and have some sort of <em>cloud-based</em> solution.  Naturally this criteria is going to leave some companies out, like Apple, Microsoft, and RIM who target apps for one mobile OS.</p>
<p><img class="alignright" title="Mobile Collaboration Wave" src="https://www.cmswire.com/images/forrester_wave_mobilecollab.jpg" alt="Mobile Collaboration Wave" width="436" height="462" /></p>
<div class="mceTemp">
<dl id="" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 446px">
<dd class="wp-caption-dd">Mobile Collaboration Wave</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>The applications included in this Wave are somewhat of a melting pot.  Adobe&#8217;s Connect application is a leader and delivers web-based conferencing.  Comparing that application to Yammer, also a leader but more of a corporate-friendly Facebook, is kind of hard.  Box.com is a file sharing and synchronizing application which is completely different than Connect or Yammer.</p>
<p>Still, the collaboration space is a very broad market consisting of a variety of application types.  It is good to see an evaluation of these different companies not based just on the product they deliver, but on many other factors, such as strategy and market presence.</p>
<p>Forrester rates the leaders in these categories as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Current Offerings: Box, IBM, and Yammer</li>
<li>Strategy: Skype, Box, Cisco, and Yammer</li>
<li>Market Presence: Skype, Cisco, and Google</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have access to Forrester.com, you can read a quick review of this Wave on CMS Wire <a href="http://www.cmswire.com/cms/mobile/new-forrester-wave-highlights-leaders-in-mobile-collaboration-012304.php" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You want to build a an application once and deploy it to lots of different devices without much rework.  That&#8217;s an age-old problem that we once thought would go away with modern web browsers.  But now we have a new take on this issue:  Web vs Native applications on mobile devices.</p>
<p>Well, two products are trying to help with build once, deploy anywhere: Adobe Flash Builder and IBM Web Experience Factory.  These tools are targeted toward different kinds of developers, but they both have features that &#8216;easily&#8217; target multiple devices.</p>
<div style="width: 638px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class=" " title="Flash Builder for iOS" src="http://devgirl.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Screen-shot-2011-06-14-at-10.56.55-PM.png" alt="Flash Builder for iOS" width="628" height="432" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Pick iOS in Flash Builder 4</p></div>
<p>Adobe Flash Builder:  I understand that it is not widely known that Flash Builder will let you build native iOS applications, in addition to Flash and Flex applications.  Holly Shinsky, @devgirlFL, explains how easy it is to use Flash Builder to create iOS applications using Flex/Air, both from Adobe.  Here is a link to the article on her blog:  <a href="http://devgirl.org/2011/06/20/flexair-for-ios-development-process-explained/">Flex/AIR for iOS Development Process</a>.</p>
<p>As you can see the image to the right, Apple iOS and Google Android applications can be generated right out of Flash Builder.  Of course, you can&#8217;t deploy Flash applications to the iPhone, but Flex applications work fine.</p>
<p>IBM Web Experience Factory:  IBM has just released Web Experience Factory Version 7.0.1.  (Web Experience Factory used to be called Portlet Factory, but since it does so much more than build portlets, IBM wisely changed its name.)    Web Experience Factory now includes Mobile and Multi-Channel support.  This allows you to build one application and deploy it to Portal, WebSphere Application Server and now mobile devices.  Here is a link to the <a href="http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/pfwiki.nsf/dx/Announcing_IBM_Web_Experience_Factory_7.0.1">announcement</a> where you can get more details.</p>
<p>Applications built by Web Experience Factory are not native applications, but are web browser based.  Support for mobile devices includes two new, cool features though.  First, Factory uses its Profiling feature to allow you to target various devices in one code base.  By enabling the mobile UI features, your application will tailor itself to various mobile devices, including iOS and Android.  This video shows you how you can build a muli channel application using Facotry: <a href="http://youtu.be/HlbYsmhDBC4">Build multi-channel application in 13 minutes.</a></p>
<p>The second new feature in Web Experience Factory is the support for many device specific features such as Geolocation, selectable lists, phone numbers, etc.</p>
<p>You can access videos about Web Experience Factory <a href="http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/pfwiki.nsf/dx/Web_Experience_Factory_Video_Gallery">here</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Adobe CQ5 has been getting a lot of great reviews by many analysts.  In the latest <a href="http://blogs.perficient.com/digitaltransformation/2011/07/20/forrester-releases-new-wcm-wave-and-welcome-to-a-new-acronym/">Forrester publication</a>, CQ5 jumped into the leader wave.  I recently had a chance to look into the mobile support provided by CQ5 and I must say, Adobe has a compelling story for users and developers.</p>
<p>In the following video, <a href="http://d36xuy0ma32835.cloudfront.net/media/cq54screencasts/cq54-mobile-en-high.ogv">Going Moble on Adobe CQ5</a> ,you get to see how CQ5 lets you view your page on many different mobile devices, which a lot of other vendors offer.  Something I think is more unique to Adobe is that CQ5 let&#8217;s you edit the page right in the emulated mobile device, so you can see exactly what happens as you make the changes. <a href="http://blogs.perficient.com/digitaltransformation/2011/07/26/going-mobile-with-adobe-cq5/cq5-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-2778"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2778" title="cq5" src="https://blogs.perficient.com/digitaltransformation/files/2011/07/cq5-300x203.png" alt="" width="300" height="203" /></a></p>
<p>The image to the right shows the user editing a title on a page destined for a mobile device.  Editing the page right on the emulated device lets you experiment with what works best without the crazy edit/preview cycle in so many other systems.  What you see in the video is that you can edit the image right there as well.</p>
<p>Another nice feature of CQ5 is that you can tailor a page for a mobile device, but also share contents on that page with other devices.  Through a mechanism they call inheritance, you can have a mobile page inherit contents from a regular web page, and then just alter parts of the mobile page.  This helps when the image on the page has to change for the mobile device, but everything else stays the same.  With inheritance, as the page content changes on the web, it will get reflected in the mobile version, but the image will be overridden.</p>
<p>CQ5 also lets you build native applications for various devices, including Android and iOS.  As a developer, CQ5 will let you take advantage of the capabilities of each mobile device to sync content from the web site to the mobile device.</p>
<p>Finally, if you are an iPad user, CQ5 has an optimized authoring tool to allow you to preview and approve content right from your iPad.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Application-Development/Adobe-Flash-Builder-45-Flex-45-Aimed-at-Mobile-Apps-436835">eWeek has a short article</a> out about the Adobe&#8217;s updated Flash Builder 4.5 and Flex 4.5 aimed at mobile development.   Adobe continues to follow their model for using Flash as a Mobile Enterprise Application Platform (MEAP).  While still relatively young, small vendors like <a href="http://pyxismobile.com/">Pyxis</a> and even larger vendors like IBM are pushing a strategy of write once and run everywhere (iOS, Android, Blackberry, HTML5 mobile sites, etc.)  When talking to some of our techies at Perficient, they really like Adobe&#8217;s development tools like Flash Builder.  One architect compared it to Windows development tools from back in the late 90&#8217;s that just worked when viewed against the sometimes painful development with JavaScript.   His point: you can gain higher developer productivity with these tools.</p>
<p>The only concern to have with all the MEAP tools is that it&#8217;s still the wild west in the mobile development world.   Competing standards, tools, and vendors make it hard to see who the winner will be.  Regardless, Adobe already has a strong start using tools creative designers around the world already know and love.</p>
<p>Anyway, check out <a href="http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Application-Development/Adobe-Flash-Builder-45-Flex-45-Aimed-at-Mobile-Apps-436835">eWeek</a> to see examples and descriptions of mobile sites that use Adobe Flash to deliver.</p>
