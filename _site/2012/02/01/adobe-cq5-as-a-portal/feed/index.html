		<description><![CDATA[Yes, you have encountered one of the many problems with trying to integrate separate systems like WebCenter and Adobe.  I&#039;m not that familiar with Coherence, but I thought it was used for data and object caching.  So for things like CSS and Javascript they would not go into the Coherence cache.   I think you will have to look at the CQ5 side to see how it caches the html it produces.  That way your WebCenter portal doesn&#039;t worry about caching, and you take care of that in CQ5.

CSS and Javascript can also be cached using CDNs, browser cache and speciality built edge cache systems.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Mark. From this it looks like, I will not only have some resources for my Webcenter Portal coming from CQ5 but also all the presentation logic corresponding to these resources coming from CQ5 (including all the CSS styling and Javascript that goes on those components). And I just need to call this resource directly using URL or build a JSR 268 portlet to consume it in my Webcenter Portal. Is my understanding right?


If so, how would I build a caching layer on top of this. If I want to cache, let us say some of the images stored in CQ5 in an intermediate caching layer like Coherence, it is going to be complicated as the presentation logic for  that image and its container component is also stored in CQ5.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, Adobe CQ5 has REST APIs, and is built on a standard JCR using Apache Jackrabbit as the implementation.  CQ5 also has JSR 286 portlets that can be used to display content in JSR 286 containers, which Webcenter is one.  You can find all the documentation for this here: http://dev.day.com/docs/en/cq/current.html

Look for &quot;Developing on AEM&quot; and it will give you what you need.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mark, I need to leverage content hosted in Adobe CQ5 and surface that in a portal built using Oracle Webcenter. Can you point me to the right resources to make this integration work? Are there REST APIs that can help? I am assuming there are JCR 170 APIs as well.]]></description>
